<h2>EDITOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The descriptions of Southern life in this
little book, as well as the accompanying
stories, were written by Mrs. Devereux
during the past fifteen years, in large part
after she had passed her sixty-fifth year.
They are essentially reminiscent, and were
prepared originally with no thought of
publication, but merely to be read to her
grandchildren, so that there might be preserved
in their minds some conception of
the old-time lives of their grandparents.
The sketches thus came to be read by me
to my own children, who are of the third
generation. They brought to my mind so
simply, yet so vividly and in so attractive a
manner, a picture of the old plantation life,
they showed such remarkable memory of
interesting details, that they seemed to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
to merit publication. The charm of the
descriptions will impress all readers, and
the truthfulness of the illustrations of negro
character and habits will be recognized by
all who are familiar with the South. The
sketches are simple, homely little tales prepared
for children, and they must be read
with this fact in mind; but they have
nevertheless an interest and a lesson for
maturer readers, to whom they are now
offered.</p>

<h2>TO MY GRANDCHILDREN</h2>


<p>As the &ldquo;New South,&rdquo; with all its changes and
improvements, rises above the horizon, those
whose hearts still cling to the &ldquo;Old South&rdquo; look
sadly backward and sigh to see it fade away into
dimness, to be soon lost to sight and to live only
in the memory of the few. Hoping to rescue
from oblivion a few of the habits, thoughts, and
feelings of the people who made our South what
it was, I have drawn from memory a few pen
sketches of plantation life, based upon actual
events, in which are recorded some of the good
and even noble traits of character which were
brought forth under the yoke of slavery.</p>

<p>For you, my dear grandchildren, I have tried
to fix, before they fade entirely, these already
faint reflections from the &ldquo;light of other days.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PLANTATION LIFE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapil"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> am going to try to describe to
you something of the lives and
homes of your dear grandfather
and of your great-grandfather,
because I want you to know something of
them, because their mode of life was one
of which scarcely a vestige is left now, and
because, finally, I don&rsquo;t want you to be led
into the misconception held by some that
Southern planters and slaveholders were
cruel despots, and that the life of the negro
slaves on the plantation was one of misery
and sorrow.</p>

<p>Before I enter upon my brief narrative I
want you to realize that it is all strictly true,
being based upon my knowledge of facts;
very simple and homely in its details, but
with the merit of entire truthfulness.</p>

<p>Your great-grandfather, Thomas Pollock
Devereux, and your grandfather, John
Devereux, were planters upon an unusually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
large scale in North Carolina; together
they owned eight large plantations and between
fifteen and sixteen hundred negroes.
Their lands, situated in the rich river bottoms
of Halifax and Bertie counties, were
very fertile, the sale crops being corn, cotton,
and droves of hogs, which were sent to
Southampton county, Virginia, for sale.</p>

<p>The names of your great-grandfather&rsquo;s
plantations were Conacanarra, Feltons,
Looking Glass, Montrose, Polenta, and
Barrows, besides a large body of land in
the counties of Jones and Hyde. His residence
was at Conacanarra, where the dwelling
stood upon a bluff commanding a fine
view of the Roanoke river, and, with the
pretty house of the head overseer, the small
church, and other minor buildings, looked
like a small village beneath the great elms
and oaks.</p>

<p>Your grandfather&rsquo;s principal plantation,
and our winter home, was Runiroi, in
Bertie county. The others were &ldquo;The
Lower Plantation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Over the Swamp.&rdquo;
At Runiroi we lived and called ourselves
at home, and of it I have preserved the clearest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
recollection and the fondest memories.</p>

<p>From Kehukee bluff, which we usually
visited while waiting for the ferryman on
our return journey after the summer&rsquo;s absence,
the plantation could be seen stretching
away into the distance, hemmed in by
the flat-topped cypresses. From there we
had a view of our distant dwelling, gleaming
white in the sunlight and standing in a
green oasis of trees and grass, all looking
wonderfully small amid the expanse of flat
fields around it. Apart as I now am from
the restless, never-ending push of life, when
neither men nor women have time for leisure,
when even pleasure and amusement
are reduced to a business calculation as to
how much may be squeezed into a given
time, I think it might perhaps calm down
some of the nervous restlessness that I perceive
in my dear children and grandchildren
if they could, for once, stand there in
the soft November sunshine. The splendor
of the light is veiled in a golden haze, the
brown fields bask in the soft radiance and
seem to quiver in the heat, while the ceaseless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
murmur of the great river is like a
cradle song to a sleepy child; the rattle of
the old ferryman&rsquo;s chain and the drowsy
squeak of his long sweeps seem even to
augment the stillness. The trees along the
banks appear to lack the energy to hang
out the brilliant reds and purples of autumn,
but tint their leaves with the soft shades of
palest yellow, and these keep dropping and
floating away, while the long gray moss
waves dreamily in the stillness.</p>

<p>The house at Runiroi was a comfortable,
old, rambling structure, in a green yard and
flower garden, not ugly, but quite innocent
of any pretensions at comeliness. Neither
was there, to many, a bit of picturesque
beauty in the flat surroundings; and yet
this very flatness <em>did</em> lend a charm peculiar
to itself. My eyes ever found a delight in
its purple distances and in the great, broad-armed
trees marking the graceful curves of
the river. The approach from the public
road, which followed the bank of the river,
was through the &ldquo;willow lane,&rdquo; between
deep-cut ditches, which kept the roadway
well drained unless the river overspread
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
its banks, when the lane was often impassable
for days. In the springtime, when the
tender green boughs of the willows were
swayed by the breeze, it was a lovely spot,
and a favorite resort of the children.</p>

<p>I was so young a bride, only seventeen,
when I was taken to our winter home, and
so inexperienced, that I felt no dread whatever
of my new duties as mistress. The
household comforts of my childhood&rsquo;s home
had seemed to come so spontaneously that
I never thought of <em>processes</em>, and naturally
felt rather nonplussed when brought into
contact with realities. The place had for
years been merely a sort of camping-out
place for your great-grandfather, who liked
to spend a part of the winter there; so the
house was given over to servants who made
him comfortable, but who took little heed of
anything else.</p>

<p>I recollect my antipathy to a certain old
press which stood in the back hall. The
upper part was filled with books. In the
under cupboard, Minerva kept pies, gingerbread,
plates of butter, etc. The outside
looked very dim and dusty. I could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
bear to look at it, but knew not how to
remedy its defects. I know now that it was
a handsome old piece, which a furniture-lover
would delight in. However, my youthful
appetite did not scorn Minerva&rsquo;s gingerbread,
and, as I had many lonely hours to
get through with as best I could, I would
mount the highest chair that I could find,
and ransack the old musty volumes in
search of amusement. The collection consisted
chiefly of antiquated medical works,
some tracts, etc., but once, to my delight, I
unearthed two of Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s novels,
which were indeed a treasure trove; one of
them was &ldquo;Gaston de Blondeville,&rdquo; which I
thought beautiful. I have regretted that I
did not take care of it, for I have never seen
another copy.</p>

<p>Minerva was a woman of pretty good
sense, but of slatternly habits. She had
been so long without a lady to guide her
that her original training was either forgotten
or entirely disregarded. Once, when
starting to Conacanarra for Christmas, I
charged her to take advantage of the fine
weather to give the passage floors a thorough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
scrubbing; they were bare and showed every
footprint of black mud from the outside.
When it came time to return, in spite of our
pleasant Christmas week, we were glad to
think of our own home and were rather
dismayed when the morning fixed for our
departure broke dark and very cold, with
little spits of snow beginning to fall. I was
much afraid that we should be compelled
to yield to the hospitable objections to our
going, but at last we succeeded in getting
off. We crossed at Pollock&rsquo;s (your great-grandfather&rsquo;s
ferry), so that should the storm
increase we need not leave our comfortable
carriage until we should be at home. It
was a lonely drive; the snow fell steadily
but so gently that I enjoyed seeing the
earth and the trees, the fences and the few
lonely houses that we passed all draped in
white; though we were warmly wrapped,
the anticipation of the crackling fires in our
great old fireplaces was delightful. When
we got home, the first sound that greeted
our ears, as we stepped upon the piazza,
was a mournful, long-drawn hymn. Shivering
and damp from our walk up the yard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
we opened the door, to see Minerva, with
kilted skirts, standing in an expanse of
frozen slush and singing at the top of her
voice, while she sluiced fresh deluges of
water from her shuck brush. I was too
disgusted for words, but resolved that this
should not occur again. As soon as I could
communicate with the outside world I had
the hall floors covered with oilcloth (then
the fashionable covering). Also, Minerva
was displaced, and Phyllis reigned in her
stead, but Minerva, nevertheless, always indulged
in the belief that she was indispensable
to our happiness and comfort.</p>

<p>In honor of my advent as mistress, the
floors had been freshly carpeted with very
pretty bright carpets, which were in danger
of being utterly ruined by the muddy shoes
of the raw plantation servants, recently
brought in to be trained for the house.
Although the soil generally was a soft,
sandy loam, I observed in my horseback
rides numbers of round stones scattered
about in the fields. They were curious
stones, and looked perfectly accidental and
quite out of place. Their presence excited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
my interest, and aroused my curiosity as
to their origin, which has never been gratified.
They seemed so out of place in those
flat fields! However, I determined to utilize
them and had a number collected and
brought into the yard, and with them I had
a pretty paved walk made from the house
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Our house stood upon what was known
as the &ldquo;Second Land,&rdquo; which meant a
slight rise above the wide, low grounds,
which were formerly, I believe, the bed of
the sluggish stream now known as the
Roanoke. All along the edge of these Second
Lands, just where they joined the low
grounds, there was a bed of beautiful small
gravel. I was delighted when I discovered
this and at once interested myself in having
a gravel walk made up to the front of the
house, and this was, when completed, all
that I had hoped, and served as a perfect
protection against the offending mud.</p>

<p>There was one evil, though, which I
could not guard against, and this was the
clumsy though well-meaning stupidity of a
plantation negro. One afternoon the house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
became offensive with the odor of burning
wool. I followed up the scent and, after
opening several doors, I finally traced it to
the dining-room. It was filled with smoke,
and there, in front of an enormous fire,
squatted Abby. In a fit of most unaccountable
industry she had undertaken to clean
the brass andirons, and had drawn them red
hot from the fire and placed them upon the
carpet. Of course, four great holes were the
result and, as the carpets had been made in
New York, there were no pieces with which
the holes could be mended. As I had already
decided her to be too stupid to be
worth the trouble of training, I felt no desire
to find fault with her, so I merely told
her to put them back, or rather stood by to
see it done. I did not keep her in the house
after that, but do not suppose that she ever
at all realized the mischief that she had
done.</p>

<p>One of my amusements was to watch the
birds; they were so numerous, and appeared
to be so tame. I set traps for them. This
was childish, but I was very young and
often rather at a loss to find something to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
do; so I used to take with me my small
house boy, &ldquo;Minor,&rdquo; whom I was training
to be a grand butler; he would carry the
trap and, after it had been set and baited, I
would make him guide me to the trees where
the sweetest persimmons grew; there I
would while away the morning and on the
next we would find one or more birds fluttering
in the trap, which, to Minor&rsquo;s silent
disgust, I would set free.</p>

<p>The squirrels, too, were a pleasure to me
in my horseback rides toward Vine Ridge,
especially. Your grandfather and I would
pause to watch them playing hide and seek
just like children, scampering round and
round, their pretty gray tails waving, until
some noise would send them out of sight,
and the silent forest would seem as if no
living thing were near. It was upon one of
these rides that your grandfather told me
how, when he was about twelve years old,
and spending his Christmas holidays at
Runiroi with his grandfather, he once said
that he could shoot one hundred squirrels
between sunrise and sunset. His uncle,
George Pollock Devereux, happened to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
hear him and rebuked him sharply for so
idle a boast, and when your dear grandfather
manfully stood his ground, saying
that it was not an idle boast, his uncle called
him a vain braggart, which so offended
your grandfather that he told his uncle that
he would prove the truth of his assertion.
And so, upon the following morning, he rose
early and was at Vine Ridge gun in hand,
ready to make his first shot, as soon as the
sun should appear. The squirrels were very
numerous at first, and he made great havoc
among them. Many a mile he tramped that
day, scanning with eager eyes the trees
above him, in search of the little gray noses,
hidden behind the branches, and thus it
happened that he got many a fall and tumble
among the cypress knees; but what
did that matter to his young limbs? he had
only to pick himself up again and tramp on.
As the day advanced, fewer little bright
eyes peeped from the tree-tops and his
number was not made up; he was getting
tired too, and very hungry, for he had eaten
nothing since his early breakfast. He stumbled
wearily on, however, determined not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
to fail, for he dreaded his uncle&rsquo;s triumphant
sarcasm should he do so. A few more shots
brought his number to ninety-nine, but
where was the one-hundredth to be found?
The sun was sinking to the horizon; he had
come out from the swamp and was tramping
homeward; the gun, so light in the
morning, now weighed like lead upon his
shoulder. As he looked into every tree for
that hundredth squirrel which could not be
found, the sun&rsquo;s disk was resting upon the
horizon when he turned into the willow
lane leading to the house. Just at the entrance
there stood a great chestnut oak.
This was his last chance. He paused to
take one hopeless look, when, to his unspeakable
joy, he beheld a fox squirrel seated
up among the branches. Now he knew that
the fox squirrel was the slyest, as well as the
shyest of all his kind; no creature so expert
as he in slipping out of range; there would
be no chance for a second shot, for now only
a rim of the sun was left. With a wildly beating
heart he raised his gun, took time to aim
well,&mdash;fired,&mdash;and down came his hundredth
squirrel. His wager was won; fatigue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
and hunger all gone, he hastened gayly home
and with pride emptied his bag before his
uncle and his delighted old grandfather, who
loved him above everything, and who finally
made him his heir, so that your grandfather
was quite independent of his own father.</p>

<p>When I first became acquainted with the
plantation, the sale crop was taken down to
Plymouth in a great old scow, but this was
afterward superseded by the introduction of
freight steamers, which took the produce
direct to Norfolk. These steamers proved
to be a great comfort and convenience to
us. By them we might receive anything
that we desired from Norfolk, of which
the things most enjoyed were packages of
books,&mdash;Vickry and Griffiths, booksellers,
having standing orders to send at their discretion
what they thought desirable, besides
the special orders for what we wished to
see.</p>

<p>The advent of a steamer at the landing
would cause much pleasurable excitement.
If anything of special interest was expected,
the first puff of steam from down the river
would be eagerly examined through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
spy-glass. Then would follow several days of
busy life down at the different barns from
which the corn was to be shipped. Before
the introduction of the corn-sheller, the corn
was beaten from the cob by men wielding
great sticks, or flails; others raked the grain
into an immense pile; from this pile it was
measured by select hands and put into bags,
which were carried to the steamer lying
at the landing. The men who measured
and kept the tally maintained a constant
song or chant, and designated the <i>tally</i>, or
fifth bushel, by a sort of yell. The overseer
stood by with pencil and book and scored
down each tally by a peculiar mark. The
constant stream of men running back and
forth, with bags empty or full, made a very
busy scene.</p>

<p>After the corn had been shipped, the
boat had steamed down the river, and the
place, lately so full of busy life, had returned
to its accustomed quiet seclusion, the redbirds
came to peck up the corn left upon
the ground. I remember how once, upon a
cold, gray afternoon, I put on my wraps and
ran down to the Sycamore Barn, on purpose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
to watch the shy, beautiful things. Snowflakes
were beginning to fall and whisper
about the great bamboo vines; twisted
around the trees upon the river banks, the
long gray moss hung motionless and a
thick grayness seemed to shut out the whole
world; all about me was gray,&mdash;earth, sky,
trees, barn, everything, except the redbirds
and the red berries of a great holly tree
under whose shelter I stood, listening to
the whispering snowflakes.</p>

<p>The Sycamore Barn derived its name from
a great sycamore tree near which it stood.
This tree was by far the largest that I ever
saw; a wagon with a four-horse team might
be on one side, and quite concealed from
any one standing upon the other. When
I knew it, it was a ruin, the great trunk
a mere shell, though the two giant forks,&mdash;themselves
immense in girth&mdash;still had
life in them. In one side of the trunk was
an opening, about as large as an ordinary
door; through this we used to enter, and I
have danced a quadrille of eight within
with perfect ease.</p>

<p>This tree gave its name to the field in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
which it grew, which formed part of the
tract known as the Silver Wedge. It was
about the Silver Wedge that an acrimonious
lawsuit was carried on during the
lives of your great-great-grandparents, John
and Frances Devereux. She was a Pollock,
and the dispute arose through a Mr. Williams,
the son or grandson of a certain
Widow Pollock, who had, after the death of
her first husband, Major Pollock, married a
Mr. Williams. She may possibly have dowered
in this Silver Wedge tract. At any rate,
her Williams descendants set up a claim to it,
although it was in possession of the real Pollock
descendant, Frances Devereux. It was
a large body of very rich land, and intersected
the plantation in the form of a wedge,
beginning near the Sycamore Barn, and running
up far into the Second Lands, widening
and embracing the dwelling-house and
plantation buildings. I have heard your
great-great-grandfather laugh and tell how
Williams once came to the house, and, with
a sweeping bow and great assumption
of courtesy, made your great-great-grandmother
welcome to remain in <em>his</em> house.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
After the suit had been settled, Williams
had occasion to come again to the house,
feeling, no doubt, rather crestfallen. Mrs.
Devereux met him at the door and, making
him a sweeping curtsy, quoted his exact
words, making him welcome to <em>her</em> house.</p>

<p>One of my pleasant memories is connected
with our fishing porch. This was a
porch, or balcony, built upon piles driven
into the river upon one side, and the other
resting upon the banks. It was raised some
eight or ten feet above the water and protected
by a strong railing or balustrade and
shaded by the overhanging branches of a
large and beautiful hackberry tree. It made
an ideal lounging-place, upon a soft spring
afternoon, when all the river banks were a
mass of tender green, and the soft cooing of
doves filled the air. We usually took Minor
with us to bait our hooks and assist generally,
and often went home by starlight with
a glorious string of fish.</p>

<p>The drawback to the plantations upon
the lower Roanoke lay in their liability to
being flooded by the freshets to which the
Roanoke was exposed. These were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
especially to be dreaded in early spring, when
the snow in the mountains was melting. I
have known freshets in March to inundate
the country for miles. At one time there
was not a foot of dry land upon one of the
Runiroi plantations. It was upon a mild
night in that month that I sat upon the porch
nearly all through the night, feeling too
anxious to sleep, for your grandfather, the
overseer, and every man on the plantation
were at the river, working upon the embankments.
The back waters from the
swamp had already spread over everything.
This gentle and slow submersion did no
great damage, when there was no growing
crop to be injured; the thing to be guarded
against was the breaking of the river dam
and the consequent rushing in of such a
flood as would wash the land into enormous
holes, or &ldquo;breakovers,&rdquo; of several acres in
extent in some places, or make great sand
ledges in others, to say nothing of the destruction
of fences, the drowning of stock,
etc. On the night that I speak of, the moon
was at its full and glittered upon the water,
rippling all around where dry land should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
have been. I sat listening anxiously and
occasionally shuddering at a sharp cracking
noise, like a pistol shot, and, following upon
it, the rushing of water into some plantation
up the river. Once in the night I heard a
noise and, upon my calling to know who it
was, a man replied that they had come up in
a canoe to get some water. I could not help
laughing; it struck me that water was rather
too plentiful just then. They worked upon
the dam until there was no more material
to work with, water being level with the top
on both sides and only a foot of standing-room
at the top, so, having done all that
they could, all hands took to canoes and
went to their homes. That &ldquo;March freshet&rdquo;
did incalculable damage to the whole region,
but still fine crops were made that season.
Your grandfather was indefatigable while
anything could be done, but, having done
all that human energy could, he would resign
himself cheerfully to the inevitable, and
his family never were saddened by depression
on his part. This wonderful elasticity
was most noticeable at the fearful period of
the surrender and, indeed, through all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
succeeding years, when this power of his,
despite all of our losses and anxieties, made
our life one of great happiness.</p>

<p>When, during the winter months, a moderate
freshet meant nothing more serious
than the flooding of the low grounds, it was
considered rather a benefit, owing to the
rich deposit left upon the land, besides the
advantages gained in floating out lumber
from the swamps. This March freshet
caused great pecuniary loss; new dams had
to be constructed at a heavy expense, and
many miles of repairing had to be done to
those left standing. The few days before
the water had reached its height were most
trying to the nerves (that is, my nerves). I
believe my fears culminated upon the night
that I saw the water rippling over our own
doorstep and realized that there was not a
foot of dry land visible for miles; by morning,
though, the river was &ldquo;at a stand,&rdquo; and
by evening little spots of green were showing
themselves in the yard and garden.</p>

<p>The word garden recalls to my memory
our pretty garden, a most beautiful continuation
of the smooth green yard, its many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
alleys bordered with flowers and flowering
shrubs. It was, I own, laid out in a stiff,
old-fashioned manner, very different from
the present and far more picturesque style;
still, it was charming,&mdash;the profusion of
flowers, fed by that wonderful river loam,
exceeded anything that I have ever seen
elsewhere. In the springtime, what with
the flowers, the beautiful butterflies, and the
humming-birds, the sunny air would actually
seem to quiver with color and life.</p>

<p>Every plantation had a set of buildings
which included generally the overseer&rsquo;s
house, ginhouse, screw, barn, stable, porkhouse,
smokehouse, storehouse, carpenter&rsquo;s
shop, blacksmith shop, and loomhouse,
where the material for clothing for each
plantation was woven,&mdash;white cloth for
the underclothes, and very pretty striped or
checked for outer garments. At Runiroi,
the weaver, Scip, was a first-class workman,
and very proud of his work. I often had
sets of very pretty towels woven in a damask
pattern of mixed flax and cotton. The winter
clothing was of wool, taken from our
own sheep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
The carpenters at Runiroi were Jim, the
head carpenter, Austin, and Bill, who were
all good workmen. Frank, &ldquo;Boat Frank,&rdquo;
as he was called, from having formerly
served as captain of the old flat-bottomed
scow which carried the sale crop to Plymouth,
was also in the shop and did beautiful
work. I was fond of visiting Jim&rsquo;s shop
and ordering all sorts of wooden ware, pails,
piggins, trays, etc.; these last, dug out of
bowl-gum, were so white that they looked
like ivory. Boat Frank was very proud of
the smoothness and polish of his trays. Our
children, with their mammy, were fond of
visiting &ldquo;Uncle Jim&rsquo;s&rdquo; shop and playing
with such tools as he considered safe for
them to handle, while Mammy, seated upon
a box by the small fire, would indulge in
long talks about religion or plantation gossip.
That shop was indeed a typical spot;
its sides were lined to the eaves with choice
lumber, arranged systematically so that the
green was out of reach, while that which
was seasoned was close at hand. Uncle
Jim would have felt disgraced had a piece
of work made of unseasoned wood left his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
shop. The smoke from the small fire which
burned in the middle of the big shop, upon
the dirt floor, escaped in faint blue wreaths
through the roof, leaving behind it a sweet,
pungent odor. The sun streamed in at the
wide-open door, while Jim and Frank tinkered
away leisurely upon plough handles
and other implements or household articles.</p>

<p>Uncle Jim was a preacher as well as a
carpenter. He was quite superior to most
of his race, both in sense and principle
and was highly thought of by both white and
black. Upon two Sundays in each month
he preached in the church and his sermons
were quite remarkable, teaching in
his homely way the necessity of honesty
and obedience. His companion in the shop,
Boat Frank, was of a more worldly nature,
and wore great golden hoops in his ears
and a red woolen cap upon his head, and
resembled an elderly and crafty ape, as he
sat chipping away at his work.</p>

<p>Next came the blacksmith shop, where
Bob wielded the great hammer and grinned
with childish delight at seeing the children&rsquo;s
enjoyment when the sparks flew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
After the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop came the
loomhouse, where Scip, the little fat weaver,
threw the shuttles and beat up the homespun
cloth from morning till night; there,
too, were the warping-bars, the winding-blades,
and the little quilling-wheel, at which
a boy or girl would fill the quills to be in
readiness for the shuttles. Scip was an odd
figure, with his short legs, and his woolly
hair combed out until his head looked as
big as a bushel.</p>

<p>The dwellings of the negroes were quite
a distance from the &ldquo;Great House,&rdquo; as that
of the master was called, and were built in
two or more long rows with a street between.
This was the plan upon every plantation.
Each house had a front and back piazza,
and a garden, which was cultivated or
allowed to run wild according to the thrift
of the residents. It generally was stocked
with peach and apple trees, and presented
a pretty picture in spring, when the blue
smoke from the houses curled up to the sky
amid the pink blossoms, while the drowsy
hum of a spinning-wheel seemed to enhance
the quiet of the peaceful surroundings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
The church at Runiroi was large and
comfortably furnished with seats; colored
texts were upon the walls, and the bell,
which summoned the people on Sunday
mornings, swung amid the branches of a
giant oak. Both your great-grandfather
and grandfather employed a chaplain. At
Runiroi, he officiated only upon alternate
Sundays, as the people liked best to listen
to Carpenter Jim. It used to be a pretty
sight upon a Sunday morning to see the
people, all dressed in their clean homespun
clothes, trooping to church, laughing and
chattering until they reached the door, when
they immediately would assume the deepest
gravity and proceed at once to groan
and shake themselves more and more at
every prayer. The singing would often
sound very sweet at a distance, although
I must confess that I never sympathized in
the admiration of the negro&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>Of course, like all other laboring classes,
the negroes had to work, and of course, as
they had not the incentive of poverty, discipline
was necessary. They knew that
they would be housed, clothed and well fed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
whether they earned these comforts or not;
so, in order to insure diligence, reliable men
were chosen from among them as assistants
to the white overseers; these were called
&ldquo;foremen,&rdquo; and were looked up to with
respect by their fellows. Upon every large
plantation there was also a Foreman
Plower, his business being to take the
lead and see that the plowing was well
done and that the plow horses were not
maltreated. With the settled men this was
unnecessary, but it was very needful with
the younger hands. These colored foremen
were, in their turn, subject to the overseers,
who, in turn, if not found to be temperate
and reliable, were dismissed. Upon well-ordered
plantations punishments were rare,
I may say unknown, except to the half-grown
youths. Negroes, being somewhat lacking
in moral sense or fixed principles, are singularly
open to the influence of example; and
thus it was that a few well-ordered elders
would give a tone to the whole plantation,
while the evil influences of one ill-disposed
character would be equally pronounced.</p>

<p>The plantations of which I am speaking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
were singularly remote, being so surrounded
by other large plantations that they were
exempt from all outside and pernicious influences.
The one or two country stores
at which the negroes traded might have
furnished whiskey, had not those who kept
them stood too much in awe of the planters
to incur the risk of their displeasure.
As the town of Halifax could boast of several
little stores, and was the trading post
of Feltons, Conacanara, and Montrose, your
great-grandfather, in order to prevent the
evils of promiscuous trading, caused certain
coins to be struck off, of no value except to
the one merchant with whom his people
were allowed to trade.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will be surprised to know
how important to the country merchants
was the trade of a plantation, so I will explain
to you of what it consisted. Of course,
a few of the careless, content with the abundance
provided for them, did not care to
accumulate, while others, naturally thrifty,
amassed a good deal from the sale of otter,
coon, mink, and other skins of animals
trapped. Then, some owned as many as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
thirty beehives. One old woman, known
as &ldquo;Honey Beck,&rdquo; once hauled thirty or
more gallons of honey to Halifax and back
again, the whole distance (twenty-five miles),
rather than take a low price for it. Besides
skins, honey, and beeswax, eggs and poultry
were always salable. One of my necessities
in housekeeping was a bag of small
change, and, as I never refused to take what
was brought to me, my pantry was often so
overstocked with eggs and my coops with
ducks and chickens, that it was a hard matter
to know how to consume them.</p>

<p>The beautiful white shad, now so highly
prized in our markets, were then a drug.
It was the prettiest sight in the early dawn
of a spring morning to see the fishermen
skimming down the broad river with their
dip-nets poised for a catch. My opportunities
for seeing them at that early hour were
from my bedroom window, when I happened
to be visiting the family at Conacanara.
Our home at Runiroi stood some distance
from the river, but the dwelling at
Conacanara was upon a bluff just over the
stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
Beside the sale crops of cotton and corn,
sweet potatoes were raised in large quantities
for the negroes, to which they were allowed
to help themselves without stint, also
a summer patch of coarse vegetables such
as they liked.</p>

<p>The regular food furnished consisted of
corn meal, bacon or pickled pork, varied
with beef in the autumn, when the beeves
were fat, salt fish with less meat when desired,
molasses, dried peas and pumpkins
without stint (I mean the peas and pumpkins).
I don&rsquo;t suppose any laboring class
ever lived in such plenty.</p>

<p>A woman with a family of children always
had the use of a cow, the only proviso
being that she should look after the calf
and see that it did not suffer, for your
grandfather was particular about his ox
teams; they were the finest that I ever saw,
and were well blooded,&mdash;Holstein for size
and Devon for speed and activity.</p>

<p>Our dairy was very pretty; it was built of
immense square logs, with a paved brick
floor, and great broad shelves all around.
The roof was shaded by hackberry trees,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
and the grass around it was like velvet, so
thick and green. Old Aunt Betty, who was
the dairy woman until she grew too infirm,
was the neatest creature imaginable; she
wore the highest of turbans, and her clothes
were spotless. She took the greatest pride
in her dairy; for milk vessels she used great
calibashes with wooden covers, and, as they
naturally were absorbent, it was necessary
to sun one set while another was in use.
She kept them beautifully, and the milk
and butter were delicious.</p>

<p>There was a man upon the plantation
called &ldquo;Shoe Joe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentleman Joe.&rdquo; He
had, when a young man, been body-servant
to his young master George, your great-grandfather&rsquo;s
brother. I never in my life
have seen finer manners than Joe&rsquo;s, so
deeply respectful, and so full of courtesy.
Notwithstanding his really fine deportment,
Joe&rsquo;s nature was low and mean, and something
that he did so offended his young
master that, to Joe&rsquo;s great disgust, he was
remanded back to the plantation and field
work. In consequence of this, he always bore
his young master a grudge, which, of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
he kept to himself. Once, however, he made
some disrespectful speech before old Betty,
who was devoted to her Master George, and
this so offended her that she never again
spoke to Joe, nor allowed him to make her
shoes, though this last was more from fear
than vindictiveness. For Shoe Joe was suspected
of being a trick negro, and of possessing
the power so to trick his work as
to cause the death of any one wearing his
products. Nothing was productive of more
evil upon a plantation than was the existence
upon it of a &ldquo;Trick&rdquo; or &ldquo;Goomer&rdquo;
negro; and so insidious was their influence,
and so secret their machinations, that,
though suspected, it was impossible to prove
anything, for, although detested by their
fellows, fear kept the latter silent. Nothing
would cause such abject terror as the discovery
of an odd-looking bundle, wrapped
and wrapped with strands of horse-hair,
secreted beneath the steps, or laid in an
accustomed path. Instantly after such a
discovery the person for whom it was meant
would begin to pine away, and, unless some
counter spell were discovered, death would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
ensue. These occurrences, fortunately, were
rare, but if the thing once took root upon
a plantation, it wrought much evil in various
ways. Joe was suspected of these evil
practices, and, though a wonderfully capable
man at all kinds of work, and a most
accomplished courtier, was always looked
upon with suspicion. His death was sudden,
and the people firmly believed that he
had made a compact with the devil, that the
term had expired, and that Satan had met
him in the woods and broken his neck. He
was a tall, finely formed man, as black as
ebony, and his movements always reminded
me of a serpent.</p>

<p>Negroes, even in these days of school
education, retain many of their superstitions,
though ashamed to own it. One of their
beliefs was that the word <em>you</em> meant the
devil&rsquo;s wife, and it was insulting to address
any one by that word. To one another it
was always <i>yinna</i>. So marked was this
custom that the negroes of that section were
known as the yinna negroes. This word,
though, was never used toward their superiors,
who were invariably addressed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
third person. Manuel was rather a common
name among them; there were always two
or three Manuels upon every plantation, and
one was always called &ldquo;Hoodie Manuel.&rdquo;
No one could ever discover what this meant;
perhaps they did not know themselves,
though I am rather inclined to think that
it was a superstitious observance, understood,
perhaps, only by a select few. I think
it must have had some sort of significance,
as it was never omitted. As soon as one
Hoodie Manuel died, another Manuel assumed
the title, though not always the
oldest.</p>

<p>It was not required of a woman with a
large family to do field work. Such women
had their regular tasks of spinning allotted
to them, sufficiently light to allow ample
time to take care of their houses and children.
The younger women (unless delicate)
left their children in a day nursery in charge
of an elderly woman who was caretaker.
Usually they preferred field work, as being
more lively; but if one disliked it, she usually
soon contrived to be classed among the
spinners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
When, occasionally, I happened to go to
any of the houses, often quite unexpectedly,
I can assert truthfully that I never, in a
single instance, saw dirt or squalor in one
of them. The floors were clean, the beds
comfortable, with white and wonderfully
clean blankets. Everything, though very
homely, with clumsy benches and tables,
looked white and thoroughly clean. I remember
hearing your grandfather speak of
once going at breakfast time to a house to
visit a sick child. The man of the house
was seated at a small table while his wife
served him. The table was covered with
an immaculately clean homespun cloth, and
coffee, in a tin pot shining with scrubbing,
either sugar or molasses, I forget which, a
dish of beautifully fried bacon and hoe-cakes,
fresh from the fire, constituted his plain but
most abundant meal.</p>

<p>Separation of families has ever been a favorite
plea for the abolition of slavery, and I
admit that in theory it was a plausible argument;
and justice compels me to say that
such instances, though rare, were not unknown.
As a rule, however, family ties were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
respected, and when, through the settlement
of an estate, such separations seemed impending,
they were usually prevented by
some agreement between the parties; for instance,
if a negro man had married a woman
belonging to another planter, a compromise
was generally effected by the purchase of
one of the parties, regardless of self-interest
on the part of the owners. Thus families
were kept together without regard to
any pecuniary loss. Public sentiment was
against the severing of family ties.</p>

<p>Before I close this little sketch I will
tell you as well as I can the outline of plantation
work.</p>

<p>With the beginning of a new year, the
crop being all housed, the sale corn being
stored in large barns or cribs on the river
banks, and the cotton either being sold or
kept for better prices, the plowing, ditching,
and, when the swamps were full, the floating
out of timber, were all carried on with
great diligence. At Christmas, when all the
clothing, shoes, and Kilmarnock caps had
been given out to the ditchers, high waterproof
boots were distributed. It was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
custom to allow to every man who desired
it a bit of land, upon which, in his spare
time, to cultivate a small crop, for which he
was paid the market price. Christmas was
the usual day chosen for settling these
accounts, and the broad piazza was full
of happy, grinning black faces gathered
around the table at which the master sat,
with his account-book and bags of specie.
A deep obeisance and a scrape of the foot
accompanied each payment, and many a
giggle was given to the lazy one whose
small payment testified to his indolence.
What a contrast between those happy,
sleek, laughing faces and the sullen, careworn,
ill-fed ones of now! In the early
springtime, what was known as the &ldquo;trash-gang,&rdquo;
that is, boys and girls who had never
worked, were set to clearing up fences,
knocking down cotton stalks, and burning
small trash piles.</p>

<p>I pause here to say that, the woodlands
being a long distance from the quarters,
the supply of fuel was a serious question,
and when there was a threat of snow or
increasing cold, every man would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
employed in cutting or hauling a supply of
fuel to the houses.</p>

<p>Planting time began with the middle of
March. In August the crops were &ldquo;laid
by.&rdquo; The three days&rsquo; holiday began with
the slaughter of pigs and beeves, in preparation
for the annual dinner upon every
plantation. After holiday came the fodder-pulling,
a job hated by all, especially by overseer
and master, as the drenching dews and
the hot sun combined to make much sickness.
This work was never begun until late
in the morning, but even after the sun had
shone upon the fields, the people would be
drenched in dew to their waists. Next, the
whitening fields told that cotton-picking
must begin, and, later on, a killing frost
upon the already browning shucks sent the
great wagons to the fields, where the corn-gatherers,
with sharp needles tied to their
wrists, ripped open the tough shucks and
let loose the well-hardened ears of grain.
As each field became stripped, stock would
be turned in to feast upon the peas and
pumpkins.</p>

<p>With winter came that period of bliss to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
the soul of Cuffee, namely, the hog-killing,
when even the smallest urchin might revel
in grease and fresh meat.</p>

<p>If eyesight permitted, I might tell you
some tales of plantation doings which might
perhaps amuse you, but I have said enough
to give you some idea of the old Southern
life. All that I have said is within bounds,
but, after all, I fear I have not been able to
give you an adequate idea of the peacefulness
and abundance of life upon a great
plantation.</p>

<h2>GOING TO THE PLANTATION</h2>


<p><span class="dropcaps"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>ummer is over; the nights
grow chill, and the autumnal
tints, beginning to glow upon
the hillsides, tell the low-country
folk that the time draws near for the
yearly flitting to their plantation homes.
The planter, who passes the hot season
amid the breezy uplands, begins to think
of his whitening cotton fields, and grows
impatient for the frost, which must fall ere
the family may venture into the land of
swamps and agues. He looks out upon the
flower-beds, glowing with life and quivering
in the sunshine, and listens to the incessant
shrill-voiced cicada piping from the tree-tops,
while the insect-drone, in the heated,
languid air, seems to speak of an unending
summer; but as &ldquo;all things come to him
who waits,&rdquo; so at length come the frosts to
the planter.</p>

<p>The week preceding the departure is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
busy one, embracing, along with the numberless
good-byes, many important afterthoughts
in the way of providing the
necessities required in the isolated home,
where shops are unknown. At length,
however, the great boxes are closed, and
stand ready for the daylight start of the
wagon; the bird-cage, the basket of kittens,
and the puppy are also committed by the
children to &ldquo;Ung Jack,&rdquo; the teamster, who,
with the broadest of smiles, promises &ldquo;little
missis&rdquo; and the &ldquo;little masters&rdquo; to take
the best of care of them.</p>

<p>Giving the baggage a day&rsquo;s start, the
family&rsquo;s departure takes place on the day
following. After an early breakfast, Mammy
and the younger children bundle into the
big carriage, mother and the rest of the
little mob follow in the <i>barouche</i>, while papa,
who abhors the confinement of a carriage,
follows on horseback. Although the animal
which he bestrides is a noble specimen
of his kind, still it must be confessed that
papa does not present a jaunty appearance
as he jogs soberly along; and yet, as he sits
easily swaying in the saddle, there is about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
him a careless grace which marks the natural
horseman.</p>

<p>Three days are consumed upon the journey.
It might be made in less time; but the
party prefer to take it easily, and at midday
make a halt by a running stream, where,
seated upon a fallen log or mossy bank,
they open their well-stored baskets, and
dine. The horses utter impatient whinnies
as their drivers dip their buckets into the
sparkling water of the little stream, and,
when these are lifted to their heads, thirstily
thrust their muzzles into the cool depths,
and drink long and deeply of the refreshing
draughts.</p>

<p>At sunset, the tired little ones begin to
look out for the white chimneys of old
John Tayler&rsquo;s wayside inn, where they are
to pass the night. This house has, for generations,
been the halting-place for planters&rsquo;
families. Tayler&rsquo;s grandfather and his
father have entertained bygone generations;
and so it is not strange that when the little
cort&egrave;ge draw up before the old piazza, and
the red light from the pine blaze streams
out from the open door, not only old John,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
but his wife and two elderly daughters
stand with beaming faces to give the travelers
a hearty greeting, kindly to usher them
into the carpetless room and seat them
upon the stiff &ldquo;split-bottomed&rdquo; chairs.
While the women busy themselves in
getting supper, old John talks crops and
politics to his guests, who, on their part,
calmly accept the discomforts of the little
inn as one of the unalterable laws of nature,
without any idea of the possibility of improvement,
swallow without complaint the
nauseous coffee, and rest philosophically
under the home-made sheets and blankets,
feebly wondering that so much weight
should contain so little warmth.</p>

<p>When supper is over, the women throw
a fresh torch upon the fire, and, as it
crackles up the wide chimney, and sends
its red light and sweet odors over the room,
they set themselves to their tasks of picking
the seeds from the &ldquo;raw cotton,&rdquo; for, being
famous spinners and weavers, they disdain
that which has had its staples torn by the
teeth of the gin.</p>

<p>Upon the second day, the party leave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
the hills, now gorgeous in their autumnal
brilliancy, the rocky roads, and the swiftly
running streams of the up-country, and
enter the lonely region where the great
turpentine trees rear their lofty crests, and
interminable sandy roads stretch away into
dimness between columns of stately pines
whose lofty tops make solemn music to the
sighing wind.</p>

<p>The third day finds them in &ldquo;The
Slashes,&rdquo; a desolate region inhabited by
squatters. As they jolt over corduroy roads
between pools of stagnant waters, the travelers
look out wearily upon a sparse growth
of gallberry and scrub-pine. Now and then
they pass the solitary hut of a charcoal-burner,
surrounded by its little patch of
meagre corn; a pack of cur dogs rush out
and bark fiercely, within the safe limits of
the wattle fence surrounding the premises;
white-headed children gaze from the doorways
at the passing carriages.</p>

<p>At the last settlement which they pass,
a woman and a small, pale-faced boy are
gathering in their corn crop. They are the
wife and son of Bolin Brazle, an idle but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
good-natured vagabond, who spends his
days scraping upon his fiddle up at the store,
or occasionally, upon the promise of a drink,
lending a hand in rafting tar-barrels. In
consequence of the presentation of a worn-out
mule, Bolin swears by the planter,
wants to run him for the presidency, and
obstinately refuses to receive pay for his
charcoal. The matter is finally arranged by
a barrel of corn being sent as a present
whenever a load of charcoal is needed.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the &ldquo;Slashes,&rdquo; a huddle
of houses standing irregularly in a grove
of magnificent oaks comes into view. In
passing the one which does double duty as
store and post-office, the travellers look at
it with the realization that it is the connecting
link with the outside world, as from
it the bi-weekly mail is dispensed. Inside,
some one (Brazle, no doubt) is scraping
a lively jig upon his fiddle; on the long
piazza men, lounging in chairs tilted against
the wall, take off their hats to the carriages
as they roll by. The planter draws his rein
for a little friendly greeting, and the men,
squirting tobacco juice, stand around and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
lazily report the country-side news as to
the opening of the cotton, the state of the
river, etc. Even the screech of the fiddle
has died away.</p>

<p>The long descents of the ferry hill commence,
and the carriages roll pleasantly between
deeply wooded banks. The approach
to the river is marked by long rows of tar-barrels
awaiting shipment, or rather rafting.
From this point the road has become a sort
of concrete from years of leakage from the
tar-barrels. The children shriek with joy
as the carriages come to a stop, and, craning
their heads out, they behold the great
tawny river in all its majesty. The repeated
hallooings for the ferryman are at length
responded to from far upstream. The old
scamp is off fishing, and the party seek
the shade, where a spring of clear water
bubbles from a bank. While the children
are drinking copious draughts, the parents
stroll off and take a woodland path, which,
after many a twist and turn amid thickets
of sweet myrtle and purple-berried Bermuda
Shrub, brings them to the summit of &ldquo;The
Bluff.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
Standing there, they look down upon the
river, two hundred feet below. Upon the
further side lie fields, all brown and golden
in the sunshine, level and limitless; they
stretch into the purple dimness where
cypress trees loom upon the horizon, their
flat tops mingling dreamily with the soft
autumnal hazes. Far away, amid the sun-bathed
fields, stand the trees which shelter
the plantation home, whose chimneys and
white gables are scarce visible save where a
stray sunbeam falls upon them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So to the Jews fair Canaan stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While Jordan rolled between,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>murmured the mother, as she glanced at
her husband, to whom she knew the lands
spread before them were, by inheritance
and long association, far dearer than could
be measured by the mere money value.</p>

<p>Descending again to the ferry, they find
the carriage already in the flat, and the
children scarce restrained by Mammy from
crossing without their elders. They draw
deep breaths of delight as they watch old
Bartley, with active limp, loosen the chain,
and, planting his iron-shod pole deep into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
the grating sands, send the flat upstream;
then, at a given point, they watch with
intense admiration his skill in taking the
sweeps and shooting swiftly to the other
side.</p>

<p>The horses know that they are near home,
and prick up their ears, and go briskly onward.
Scarcely a quarter of a mile is gone
before the buildings of the &ldquo;lower plantation&rdquo;
come into view,&mdash;a row of cabins
built irregularly upon the highest points
straggle along the river banks. Each cabin
has its little garden with its row of coleworts
and its beehives, or perhaps a pumpkin or
two shows its yellow sides amid the withered
vines. Outside the cabins, fish-nets are
hung to dry, and from within comes the
sleepy drone of a spinning-wheel; about
the doorstep hens are scratching, while
from around the corner a cluster of little
woolly heads peep out shyly.</p>

<p>Standing in the mellow sunlight, amid
fields of ripening corn, with the river gently
flowing between levees of such strength
as to set floods at defiance, these cabins
seem the very embodiment of peaceful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
security; the high piles, though, upon which
they stand, are rather suggestive, and give
a hint of what the now peacefully flowing
stream is capable of when roused.</p>

<p>A story is told of an old negro who
obstinately refused to leave his house at a
time when the unusually high water made
it necessary to remove the people to a place
of greater security. The rafts were ready,
and the people, scared and anxious, had left
their houses, and now only wailed for old
Todge, who, with mulish persistence, refused
to be moved. At length, unable to
persuade him, and afraid to wait longer,
they poled the rafts away. For the first
few hours Todge got on very well. He had
plenty of provisions, and, as for the isolation,
he did not care for it. By and by the
water began to make its appearance upon
his hearth, and, before long, his little bank
of coal, upon which his bread was baking,
began to sizzle, and soon became a moist
and blackened heap. Todge, however, was
not imaginative, and when night fell, he lay
down upon his bed and slept without fear;
that is, he slept until his bed began to float,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
then he awoke and groped his way neck
deep in water until he found his ladder and
managed by it to climb up into his loft,
where he sat shivering, till suddenly he
felt the cabin give a lurch, and the water
rushed in. It had been lifted clear off the
piles, and when it should settle down poor
Todge would be caught like a rat in a hole.
It was settling fast, and the water was gurgling
into poor Todge&rsquo;s ears, when, in desperation,
he made a bolt at the roof, and,
using his head as a battering ram, succeeded
in knocking a hole in it, through which he
contrived to creep out. Luckily, the point
of the chimney was not quite submerged,
and Todge was rescued in the course of
the following day.</p>

<p>The road, following the winding of the
river, is bordered by giant trees from whose
branches the gray moss waves dreamily,
while leaves of palest yellow drop and
silently float through the still air until they
fall into the stream. In the fields, the corn-gatherers
pause to doff their hats and smile
their welcome. Ere long the barns and
workshops of the upper plantation become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
visible. The tall gables and chimneys of
the great house glisten in the sunlight.
They pass the little church, with its bell
half hidden amid the brown leaves of the
great oak from which it dangles; from
cabin chimneys, half hidden in trees, thin
columns of smoke ascend and mingle with
the soft blue sky.</p>

<p>At the open gate, a broadly smiling
dusky group stands with welcome depicted
upon every face. Hearty handshakes of
real affection are exchanged, while the
children are being hugged, caressed,
laughed over, and extolled for their growth
and beauty. The master and mistress pass
under the trees, whose long shadows rest
upon the soft, green grass between streams
of sunshine. The old piazza, gilded into
brightness, smiles a welcome home.</p>

<h2>MY OWN EARLY HOME</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapil"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> was born at the old home in
Raleigh, upon the land originally
held by my great-grandfather,
Colonel Lane, from the
Crown. It had been the home of my grandfather,
Harry Lane, and of his wife, Mary,
and it was there that their children and
grandchildren were born. When my oldest
brother attained his majority, he took possession
of this place, while my mother settled
at Wills Forest, which was also part of
the Lane land. This, Wills Forest, became
our beloved summer home, which I inherited
at the death of my dear mother.
At the breaking out of the war between
the states, your grandfather left to his
subordinates his plantation interests in the
eastern part of the state, and Wills Forest
became our permanent home. Although
you never saw this place in its palmy days,
still, you are too well acquainted with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
situation to need a description. In spite of
neglect, Wills Forest is still beautiful; to
it my heart is ever turning with regret and
longing for that which can never return.
It was for many years the brightest and
happiest of homes, and as such it is still
remembered by many besides its former
inmates.</p>

<p>Hospitality has ever been a marked
characteristic of the Lane blood. Colonel
Lane&rsquo;s doors were ever open, not only to his
friends, but to every wayfarer, and as the
small settlement, originally called Bloomsbury,
became Raleigh, and the state capital,
he found it necessary to build an &ldquo;ornery&rdquo;
for the accommodation of strangers; this
building stood upon Hillsborough Street,
and was torn down only a short time ago.
These &ldquo;orneries&rdquo; were a very common adjunct
to gentlemen&rsquo;s residences in country
neighborhoods, where there were no inns
for the accommodation of travelers. We
once stopped at one belonging to the Littles,
near Littleton. It was kept by two servants,
a man and his wife, belonging to the family,
and they made us very comfortable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
My grandfather, Harry Lane, inherited
his father&rsquo;s liberal and open-hearted nature,
and the old home, even since the death of
my brother, still maintains its character for
genial hospitality. Nor was Wills Forest
inferior to it in that respect. My mother,
accustomed from earliest youth to lavish
housekeeping, kept it up after her removal
to Wills Forest, and, so long as her health
permitted, ever took delight in making her
home all that a kindly, open-handed hospitality
could. Nor do I think its character
deteriorated after your grandfather became
its master. Both he and I were fond of
society, and few strangers ever came to
town who were not entertained at Wills
Forest. This could not be possible now,
but previous to the war it was not at all
impossible, and, during the war, at times, we
received whole families of refugees. I do
not mention these facts in a boastful spirit,
but only as a sample of the old customs of
the South.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1865, we had the
pleasure of entertaining the family of Colonel
Norris of Baltimore, and early in March
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
we had an unexpected visit from a large
party of South Carolinians, who had been
wounded in an attack made by General Kilpatrick
upon Gen. Joseph E. Johnston&rsquo;s
command at Fayetteville. Your grandfather
met them in the street seeking for shelter;
and, compassionating their forlorn condition,
he directed them to Wills Forest.
When we first caught sight of the cort&egrave;ge
surrounding two ambulances, we were
alarmed, thinking that it must be the
Yankees coming to deprive us of house
and home. You may, perhaps, imagine the
relief when I saw the dear Confederate gray.
I met the cavalcade at the front steps, and
bade them welcome; the wounded were
brought in and laid upon beds in the nursery,
after which I directed one of our men,
Frank, the carriage-driver, I think it was, to
conduct the horsemen to the stable, to give
the horses a plentiful feed, and then to bring
the men up to the house to get their dinners.
In ordinary times, this unlooked-for addition
of more than twenty guests would, no doubt,
have been an unwelcome tax, but in those
days preceding the sad termination of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
war there were so many poor, half-starved
stragglers from the different commands
passing to and fro, that we were never unprepared
to feed as many as called upon us.
At this time, two cooks were kept continually
at work in the kitchen preparing such
plain food as we could command: such as
boiled hams, biscuit, loaf bread, corn bread,
and wheat coffee. The milk and butter, all
that we had, were joyfully given to our soldiers.
The gray jacket was, indeed, a passport
to every Southern heart. I have fed
many a poor, footsore &ldquo;boy in gray,&rdquo; but
never in a single instance heard a despondent
word from one of them. Most grateful
they were for their good, abundant meals,
but often too modest to carry any away in
their haversacks.</p>

<p>In times of peace, both before and after
the war, the social life at the table, with
family and always welcome friends, was a
source of much pleasure. For a dinner of
ten or twelve persons, including ourselves,
there would be a ham at the head, a large
roast turkey at the foot, a quarter of boiled
mutton, a round of beef <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
boiled turkey stuffed with oysters. In the
middle of the table would be celery in tall
cut-glass stands, on the sides cranberries in
moulds and various kinds of pickles. With
these would be served either four or six
dishes of vegetables and scalloped oysters,
handed hot from the plate-warmer. The
dessert would be a plum pudding, clear
stewed apples with cream, with a waiter in
the centre filled with calf&rsquo;s-foot jelly, syllabub
in glasses, and cocoanut or cheesecake
puddings at the corners. The first
cloth was removed with the meats. For
a larger entertainment a roast pig would
be added, ice-cream would take the place
of stewed apples. The dessert cloth would
be removed with the dessert, and the decanters
and fruit set upon the bare mahogany,
with the decanters in coasters; cigars
would follow, after the ladies had left, of
course.</p>

<p>At the time of the surrender, General Logan
borrowed, or asked to borrow, my tables
and cut-glass tumblers and wine-glasses; as
such a request meant an order, I, of course,
allowed them to be taken; to my surprise all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
were returned. Generals Grant and Sherman
were entertained by Logan at this time,
the tables being set before his tent in the
grove.</p>

<p>When my two little girls went to day
school at St. Mary&rsquo;s, their dinners were sent
to them by a negro boy or man. He carried
the basket of hot dinner, while another carried
the ice for their water, while another
often walked behind bearing a large watermelon.
As the other day-pupils dined in a
similar way, the road at this time of day
would be full of negroes carrying dinners.</p>

<p>Since these bygone days, knowledge has
increased, and men go to and fro with ease
between the far corners of the earth; but I
do not think that either virtue or happiness
has kept pace with this increase of knowledge,
nor has there ever been or will there
ever be again such a country as the Old
South, nor a people so good, so brave, or so
true-hearted as the dear, primitive people of
that good old time.</p>

<h2>TWO BOB WHITES</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>wo Bob Whites were standing
beneath the old thorn-bush at
the far end of the orchard; indeed,
they had been standing
there for some time, with their heads held
close, just as though they were talking together.
In fact, that is just what they were
doing. They were talking about the nest
that they were going to build. And it was
high time, for already there was a nice little
brood in that nest beyond the brook. But
our Bob Whites were a prudent couple;
they did not approve of those early broods
which came off barely in time to miss the
chilly May rains. But the May spell was
over now, the sun shone hot upon the waving
wheat, and over the fence, there in the
old field, the dewberries were ripe. Already
the little boys who live in the house over
yonder had been after the berries, regardless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
of briers and bare feet. Yes, it was
high time that nest was built; but, somehow,
they could not fix upon an altogether
suitable location. True, the old thorn-bush,
with its wide-spreading branches, was most
attractive; but there the cart tracks ran
too close by. As they stood thus in the
clover, all undecided, they were startled by
a loud cry from Robin Redbreast, whose
nest was high up in that apple tree. Turning
to ascertain the cause of the outcry,
they espied a great, evil-looking, yellow cat,
creeping through the long grass. This decided
them, and without waiting another
moment, they abandoned the thorn-bush
and flew away to seek a safer abode. This
they finally found over toward the wheat
field, far away from cats and all the nuisances
which attend the abodes of men.</p>

<p>The nest was built back of the old gray,
lichen-covered fence, just above the brook
where the hazels and alders grow. All
around was a blackberry thicket, and a
great tussock of brown sedges sheltered
the nest like a roof. Just beyond the fence
was the wheat field. No one ever came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
there, excepting that now and then on a
Saturday the little boys who lived over
yonder would pass by with their fishing-poles,
jump the fence, and disappear in the
hazel thickets. The Bob Whites didn&rsquo;t
mind the boys, unless Nip happened to be
along, nosing about in search of some mischief
to get into. But as yet no little white
egg lay in the nest, and when Nip cocked
his impudent little ears at them, they were
off with a whirr that sent him, scampering,
startled and scared, after the boys. From
the trees to which they had flown, the Bob
Whites watched the movements of the
boys with some anxiety. &ldquo;They might,
you know,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Bob, &ldquo;be after
that brood of our cousin&rsquo;s beyond the
brook; but no, they&rsquo;ve stopped&mdash;they are
throwing something into the water, and
there&rsquo;s that good-for-nothing Nip with
them, so we may go back to the nest.&rdquo;
But they did not go, for there was that
pert Jennie Wren fluttering about, as bold
as anything, actually peeping into the bait
gourd, and, goodness gracious! she has
stolen a worm and flown off with it; what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
impudence! And listen, there&rsquo;s Cardinal
Grosbeak singing to them,&mdash;</p>

<p>There he is, just a little above them, upon

<p>&ldquo;The song may do well enough, but we
don&rsquo;t approve of such forward ways,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs.
Mate Hare, limping from her home in the
broom sedge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe, with that
horrid little Nip so near; to be sure, they&rsquo;ve
got wings, but as for me, he just frightens
the life out of me, with his nosing and
sniffing; forever nosing and sniffing after
some mischief.&rdquo; And she wiggled her nose
and ears and looked so funny that the Bob
Whites almost laughed in her face.</p>

<p>Before long there was a little white egg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
in the nest, and Bob White was so proud
of it that he just stood upon the fences
and called, &ldquo;Bob White, Bob White, Bob
White,&rdquo; all day long. And the boys who
lived over yonder at the farmhouse said,
&ldquo;Listen to the Bob White, he&rsquo;s got a nest
over there in the wheat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo;
said the farmer; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be good shooting
over there by and by.&rdquo; But Bob White
had no thoughts to spare for by-and-bys.
The blue June sky and the rustling wheat,
the wild roses, and that little egg lying
there in the nest were enough for him. So
he just turned his round breast to the sunshine,
and called &ldquo;Bob White&rdquo; louder than
ever.</p>

<p>After a while, when the nest was full of
eggs, the Bob Whites would creep through
the wheat and whisper of the little ones
that would soon be coming. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be
here by the time the wheat is ripe,&rdquo; says
Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine feeding for them,&rdquo; replies
Mrs. Bob. They never thought of
the reapers with their sharp scythes, and of
the noise and tramping, where all was now
so peaceful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
While Mrs. Bob sat upon her eggs, it
amused her to see the Mate Hares come
limping out at sunset, very timidly at first,
pausing, startled, at every sound. Soon,
however, they forgot their fears and began
their dances, hopping and running round
and round like mad, and cutting such capers
as quite scandalized the Bob Whites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very odd!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bob, as she
settled herself over her eggs. &ldquo;I have heard
that the March Hares have a Bee in their
bonnets.&rdquo; &ldquo;Same family,&rdquo; Bob White
replied drowsily. Then Mrs. Bob, pressing
her soft feathers gently upon her eggs,
tucked her head under her wing and slept.</p>

<p>Their dance over, the Mate Hares skipped
down to the meadow, where the dew lay
thick upon the clover. &ldquo;How good!&rdquo; they
said, as they nibbled and munched. &ldquo;So
sweet and tender, with the dew upon it!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who would eat dry seeds like the Bob
Whites?&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;And go to sleep at
dusk!&rdquo; snickered another. &ldquo;And whistle all
day!&rdquo; said a third. &ldquo;As much as to say to
all men and dogs, &lsquo;Here I am, come and
shoot me;&rsquo; so silly! Oh, there&rsquo;s no family
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
like the Mate Hares for sense; come, let&rsquo;s
have another dance.&rdquo; So they skipped and
hopped and munched clover until the dawn
sent them scudding away to their homes.</p>

<p>Well, at last, upon a sunny June morning,
the lonely field was no longer lonely,
neither was it quiet; for the grain was ripe
and the reapers had come. Yes, the reapers
had come, and with them came Nip. Yes,
there he was, showing that ugly little red
tongue of his, and poking his black nose
into every hole and bush; no place was
safe from those inquisitive eyes and sharp
little cruel teeth. Mr. Bob watched him
with a fluttering heart, as he ran sniffing
about; suddenly, there came a sharp yelp,
and then Mrs. Mate Hare&rsquo;s cotton tail went
flying over rock and brier, followed by Nip,
with his short, inadequate legs. Soon, however,
he tired of this fun, and, trotting back,
cocked his ears at the brier patch, sniffed
about it, and crept in. Bob White, with an
anxious call, flew into a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a nest somewhere about
there,&rdquo; said one of the reapers. &ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s
full of eggs,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Yes, but the boss
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
has give orders that they ain&rsquo;t to be tetched,&rdquo;
said another. Then there came from the
thicket a growl and a yelp, and Mrs. Bob,
with a loud whirr, flew to her mate. &ldquo;Nip&rsquo;s
got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried one of the men, and, picking
up a stone, he ran to the thicket, from
whence now issued yelps of anguish. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
not trouble them again, I reckon,&rdquo; the man
said, with a grin, as he picked up his scythe.</p>

<p>Nip trotted home with a crestfallen and
dejected air, but the Bob Whites, still agitated,
remained in the tree, with necks
craned anxiously toward the nest. When,
at length, Mrs. Bob found courage to return,
the melancholy sight met her eyes of three
broken eggs, some more scattered ones, and
a generally disordered nest. Bob now came
to her assistance, the scattered eggs were
put back, the nest repaired, and Mrs. Bob
contentedly seated herself upon it.</p>

<p>The hatching time was drawing near,
and it was a most exciting period. Mrs.
Bob sat very still, but, as for Bob, he just
fidgeted from nest to tree and back again,
stopping around and asking questions.
Yes, one egg is pipped; they&rsquo;ll all be out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
by to-morrow. And so they were,&mdash;thirteen
little puff-balls, upon tiny coral feet.
&ldquo;There would have been sixteen, but for
that horrid Nip,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Bob. But she
was very proud and happy, as she led the
little brood through the brush, showed them
how to pick up ants&rsquo; eggs, and tore up the
soft mould for grubs and other dainties.
When the nimble little feet grew tired, she
took them to the alder thicket, where, hidden
away beneath her feathers, they piped
themselves to rest. It was very quiet now:
the reapers had gone; there was no rustling
of waving wheat, only the shocks stood up
silent; there was only the soft clang, clang
from the bell-cow, as the herd went home.
Then the sun went down, and grayness
followed, and from the thicket came the
sad cry of the Chuck Will&rsquo;s widow. But
the Bob Whites were fast asleep. At dawn,
Bob White stood upon the topmost rail,
and whistled and whistled as loud as he
could; he felt so happy that he had to
repeat, &ldquo;Bob White, Bob White&rdquo; to everything
that he saw,&mdash;to the bell-cow, as
she passed by on her way to the meadow;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
then to the boy, who popped his whip and
whistled back; then to the trees, which
nodded in return. When the sun came
glinting through the leaves and set the dewdrops
to glistening and the whole world
to laughing, he whistled louder than ever,
just for joy. But presently the reapers
came again. Then Bob White slipped
away and hid himself far down amid the
alders, where Mrs. Bob was showing the
puff-balls how to pick up grubs and how
to use their little nimble legs in running
after gnats and other good things. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
try to catch that great bee, but come and
pick up these ants&rsquo; eggs,&rdquo; she called, as she
threw aside the earth with her strong claws.
&ldquo;You must attend to what I say, for you
are very ignorant little things, and if you
are not careful to mind what I say you may
be caught up by a hawk at any moment.
So, listen: when I say &lsquo;Tuk,&rsquo; you must hide
yourselves immediately; don&rsquo;t try to run
away, but just get under a rock, or even
a leaf, or just flatten yourselves upon the
ground, if you can&rsquo;t do better; you are so
nearly the color of the ground that a boy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
will never see you, and you can even escape
a hawk&rsquo;s keen eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a while, mother and brood left the
alder thicket, and, as the reapers were now
in a distant part of the field. Mrs. Bob led
them all to a sunny spot where they might
pick upon the fallen grains and wallow in
the dry, hot sand. It was very nice to do
this, and they were having a charming
time, when suddenly voices were heard,
and at once two boys were upon them.
But not so much as one little brown head
or one little pink toe was visible; the sign
had been given, and now only a poor,
wounded Bob White lay in the path before
them. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; said one of the boys.
&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t, her wing&rsquo;s broke,&rdquo; cried the
other, as he made a dive at her. But somehow,
Mrs. Bob continued to flop the broken
wing, and to elude them. Another futile
dive, and the two tin buckets containing
the reapers&rsquo; dinners were thrown down and
forgotten in the keen interest of chasing
the wounded Bob White, who managed to
flop and flutter just beyond their reach
until she had led them quite across the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
field,&mdash;then, with a whirr, she bounded
into the air and safely perched herself upon
a distant tree. The astonished small boys
gazed blankly after her, wiped their hot
faces upon their sleeves, and turned, reluctantly,
to pick up their buckets. As they
went along, hot and crestfallen, one of them
suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got young
ones hid yonder, I bet,&rdquo; and with that they
set off at a run. Mrs. Bob White, who
knew boy-nature well, craned her neck to
watch, and fluttered nearer. Then Bob
White came, and both continued to watch
with anxiously beating hearts, for those
little boys were evidently bent upon mischief.
Would the poor little puff-balls outwit
them? One little piping cry, one brown
head raised, and all would be lost. But, as
they watched, their fears began to subside.
The boys are again wiping their hot faces,
they look discouraged, they have evidently
found nothing; yes, certainly not, for, see,
they are picking up their buckets, and now
they are going across the field to where
the reapers are calling them to hurry along
with their dinners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
Such daily annoyances as this now determined
the Bob Whites to take refuge in
the alder thicket, in whose deep seclusion
they soon regained tranquillity of spirits.
The dampness of the situation, however,
proving most unfavorable to their brood,
they anxiously awaited the time when the
departure of the reapers would restore quiet
and enable them to return to their haunts.
At length the wished-for time arrived; from
the topmost boughs of the big maple Bob
White could see neither man, boy, or dog,
in the whole length and breadth of the
field. Summoning the family together, they
joyfully crept through the brush to bask in
the broad stretches of sunshine and to pick
up the scattered grain amid the stubble.
Here they remained through all the long
summer days, their solitude broken only by
the yellow butterflies and by the big brown
grasshoppers bumping about in the stubble,
the silence broken only by the occasional
jangle from the bell-cow, as she shook
the deerflies from her sleek sides.</p>

<p>By and by, when the goldenrod was
yellow upon the hillside, the young ones,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
in their new brown coats, began to try their
wings, and felt very proud if they could
make them whirr, when they rose to the
fence or to a low brush. Had they been
boys, they would have been called hobbledehoys;
but, being Bob Whites, they were
known as squealers, and as such they felt
very mannish and ambitious to be independent;
but, nevertheless, they still liked
to huddle together at nightfall and talk
over the day&rsquo;s doings, close to, if not under,
the mother&rsquo;s wing.</p>

<p>By and by, again, when goldenrod stood
brown and sere upon the hillside and the
sumach glowed red in the fence corners
and thickets, when the fall crickets were
chiming their dirge down amid the grass
roots and the air was growing frosty at
nights, then the Bob Whites grew restless
and took flight for a far-off pea field, noted
as a feeding-ground. Here they met other
families of kinsfolks, and then began a right
royal time, running nimbly through the
rich pea vines or scratching in sassafras or
sumach thickets for insects, growing fat and
growing lazy all the time. The gourmand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
of the autumn was in manner quite a contrast
to the Bob Whites of the days of
young wheat and wild roses. No blithe,
good music now issued from that throat
so intent upon good cheer. True, some
unpleasant rumors are afloat. The Mate
Hares, scudding frantically away, reported
an advance of men, with guns and dogs;
but the Mate Hares were always silly and
unreliable. So our Bob Whites just keep
on eating and making merry. Fortune may
favor them,&mdash;who knows? Let us hope,
and listen out next year for the cheery
&ldquo;Bob White, Bob White,&rdquo; from the old
nesting-place.</p>

<h2>LITTLE DAVE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he cool fogginess of an August
morning has melted under
the fierce sun. The level fields,
like a waveless ocean, stretch
away into the dim, green distance. The
hot air quivers above cotton-fields, heavy
with bolls and gay with blossoms, which
give out a half-sickening fragrance. A
languid air rustles low amid the corn, from
whose dense growth arises a damp, hot
breath. Out in the pasture, work-horses
leisurely crop the sunburnt grass, or stand
under the trees, lazily switching away the
swarming gnats.</p>

<p>A restful quiet broods over the big plantation,
for the plow and the hoe have finished
their task; sun and showers must
do the rest. The crop is &ldquo;laid by,&rdquo; and
the summer holidays have begun. Three
days of rest before the gathering in begins.</p>

<p>Over at the quarter, the young people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
fill the long, lazy day with patting and dancing,
banjo-playing and watermelon-eating.
The elders, for the most part, are absorbed
in preparations for the big holiday dinner.
By dawn, holes have been dug in the ground
and heated for the barbecuing of various
meats, and those who hold the honorable
posts of cooks are busily engaged in basting,
tasting, and sending the small urchins
after fuel. Some of the women are kneading
flour hoe-cakes; others, gathered about
a table under a great mulberry tree, are
peeling fruit for pies, while now and then
they raise their voices with blood-curdling
threats to hasten the lagging steps of a little
gang, which, looking like a string of black
beetles, troop slowly along from the orchard,
each holding in the skirt of his solitary garment
the small store of fruit which he has
not been able to eat. A row of tables spread
in the shade stands ready for the feast, and,
along the pathway, the guests from neighboring
plantations are already approaching.</p>

<p>Up at the great house an unnatural quiet
prevails, for upon this day all work is laid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
aside and all are off to the barbecue; even
old Aunt Sylvie has forgotten the &ldquo;misery&rdquo;
in her back, has donned her Sunday garments,
and stepped briskly off to the quarter;
cook, too, has closed the ever-open
kitchen door and departed, along with
nurse, over whose toilet her little charges
have presided with so much zeal that they
have emptied their mother&rsquo;s cologne flask
in order to bedew their mammy&rsquo;s pocket-handkerchief
to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>Tiny curly-headed Jack feels rather disconsolate
without his mammy, but is partially
consoled by flattering visions of what
her pockets will bring home at the end of
the day.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Away down upon the creek the little
gristmill stands silent; the old mossy
wheel has for to-day ceased its splash and
clatter, and, like all else upon the plantation,
is resting from its labor; to-day no
sacks stand open-mouthed, awaiting their
turn; no little creaking carts, no mill boys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
mounted astride their grists are seen upon
the path, and Wat, the miller, in the lazy
content of dirt and idleness, lies basking in
the sun. Within the wattle fence on the
other side of the path, his three children,
little Dave, Emma Jane, and a fat baby, are
sprawling upon the ground, along with the
house pig, two puppies, and the chickens.
Little Dave, who is perhaps somewhat
dwarfed by toting first Emma Jane in her
infancy, and now the fat baby, looks not
unlike a careworn little ape, as he sits flat
upon the ground, spreading his bony toes
for the baby to claw at.</p>

<p>Emma Jane, with her stout little body
buttoned into a homespun frock, is also
seated in the sand, solemnly munching
upon a hunk of corn bread, while the
chickens, with easy familiarity, peck at the
crumbs which fall upon her black shins.
Within the cabin, Polly, the miller&rsquo;s wife,
has tied a string of beads about her sleek
black throat, and now, in all the bravery
of her flowered calico, is ready to set off
for the quarter; first, though, she pauses
at the gate to speak to little Dave.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
&ldquo;When de chile git hongry, you git dat
sweeten water off de shelf and gie it to him
long wid his bread;&rdquo; then adds, with a suspicion
of tenderness upon her comely face;
&ldquo;I gwine fetch you some pie.&rdquo; Then, calling
to Wat, that he had better &ldquo;fix his sef
and come along, ef he speck to git any of de
dinner,&rdquo; she steps briskly along the narrow
pathway, mounts the zigzag fence, and disappears
amid the high corn.</p>

<p>Some miles below, where the little creek
which turns the mill-wheel steals from out
the swamp to join the river, a clumsy,
flat-bottomed scow lies grounded upon a
sand-bar. This is no evil to Boat Jim, who,
sprawled upon the deck, snores away the
hours, regardless of the blistering sun beating
down upon his uncovered head, and all
unconscious of the departure of his chance
passenger, an itinerant organ-grinder. This
fellow, having had the ill luck to lose the respectable
member of the firm, his monkey,
and finding difficulty without the aid of his
little partner to attract an audience, had,
while idling about the docks, encountered
Boat Jim, and persuaded the latter to give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
him a lift up the river, the condition being
that he was to grind as much music as Jim
should desire. But, disgusted with three
days of slow progress upon the boat, he had,
after viciously kicking the unconscious Jim,
stolen the small boat and put himself ashore.
Following the windings of the creek, he
came to the little mill, where, attracted by
the shade, he seated himself close to the
wattle fence of Polly&rsquo;s little yard. Hearing
voices, he peeped through the fence, and his
eyes were soon fixed upon little Dave, who,
with the fat baby and Emma Jane for spectators,
is performing various tricks with infinite
delight to himself. He stands upon his
head, he turns somersaults, he dances, he
pats, and finally he swings himself into a
tree, where he skips about with the agility
of a monkey. A thought comes into the
organ-grinder&rsquo;s head; he glances at the silent
mill and at the cabin: evidently both
are deserted; here is a chance to replace
the dead monkey.</p>

<p>The sun is sending long shafts of crimson
light into the swamp and glinting upon
the millhouse; the high corn, awakening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
from its midday torpor, rustles softly to the
evening breeze, as Wat and Polly wend their
way homeward. A bucket, lightly poised
upon Polly&rsquo;s head, holds scraps of barbecue
and little Dave&rsquo;s promised pie, and, as
she draws near the wattle fence, she thinks,
with a pleased smile, of how she will set it before
&ldquo;de chilluns,&rdquo; when a prolonged howl
falls upon her ears. Recognizing the voice
of Emma Jane, she says to herself: &ldquo;She
hongry, I spek,&rdquo; and trudges on, in nowise
disturbed by this familiar sound. But, when
they enter the yard, there is only Emma
Jane, bawling, open-mouthed, beside the
baby, who, with the house pig, lies asleep on
the warm sand. The chickens are daintily
picking their way to the house, the old muscovy
duck has tucked her head under her
wing for the night, Old Keep, the stump-tailed
coon dog, crawls from under the
cabin to greet them. But where is Dave?</p>

<p>The miller carries the sleeping child indoors,
followed by the still bawling Emma
Jane, while the wrathful Polly goes to the
back of the house. Stripping the twigs
from a switch, she mutters: &ldquo;I knows what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
you&rsquo;s arter; you tuck yoursef to dat watermillion
patch, dat whar you gone; but ne&rsquo;
mine, boy, you jest le&rsquo; me git hold o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;
Then, after a time given to unsuccessful
search, calls of &ldquo;Da-a-vie&mdash;oh, oh, Dave!&rdquo;
fall upon the stillness, to be answered only
by weird echo from the lonely swamp.
Returning from her search, she finds Wat
seated upon the doorstep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave done took hissel off to de quarter,&rdquo;
he says; &ldquo;but no mind, I gwine fill
him full o&rsquo; licks in de mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, when morning comes and brings no
little Dave, wrath gives place to fear. The
plantation is aroused; finally the mill-pond
is dragged, and, although the body is not
found, the conclusion is that the boy has
been drowned.</p>

<p>After a time Polly&rsquo;s smile beams as
broadly as ever, but her heart still yearns
for her boy, and amid the sleepy drone of
her spinning-wheel, she pauses to listen;
or, standing in her door, she looks ever
wistfully along the crooked path. Across
the way, the little mill clatters on as merrily
as of yore; Wat heaves the great sacks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
upon his brawny shoulder, metes out the
grist, and faithfully feeds the hopper; but,
when a chance shadow falls athwart the
sunny doorway, he looks up with a gleam
of hope upon his stupid, honest face, then
brushes his hand across his eyes, and goes
on in stolid patience with his work. So
the summer and the autumn pass, without
change, save that Emma Jane substitutes
sweet potatoes for corn bread, and the fat
baby has learned to balance himself upon
his bowlegs.</p>

<p>Upon a winter evening Wat enters the
cabin at the usual hour. Polly has laid a
bit of clean homespun upon the table; his
bowl of coffee, his fried meat, and his hoe-cake
stand ready; but, instead of falling to,
as his custom is, he sits silent and despondent,
with his face buried in his hands, until
Polly asks:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What de matter; is you po&rsquo;ly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno as I &rsquo;se, to say, po&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; Wat replies,
&ldquo;but dat boy&rsquo;s been a-pesterin&rsquo; me
dis livelong day, a-callin&rsquo; &lsquo;Daddy, Daddy!&rsquo;
jes&rsquo; like I talkin&rsquo; now, till seem like I &rsquo;se
most beat out along o&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dat mighty curous,&rdquo; Polly answered,
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause Ole Keep, he&rsquo;s been a-howlin&rsquo; dis
blessed day. I &rsquo;lowed dat Ung Silas were
gwine be tuck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T ain&rsquo;t dat,&rdquo; the miller interrupted.
&ldquo;Ung Silas, he done got better; he howlin&rsquo;
arter sompen nother, but &rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t arter Ung
Silas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that identical winter&rsquo;s day, in a
back alley of New York, a small crowd of
idlers had gathered to witness the performance
of the &ldquo;Man Monkey.&rdquo; A little creature,
dressed in tinsel, leaped and capered,
keeping time to the grinding of an organ.
When the spectators were silent, he would
glance timidly at his ill-favored keeper, but
when they cheered, the poor little figure
would strive to outdo itself, in spite of laboring
breath and trembling limbs. Then
a rope was stretched, and &ldquo;The Man
Monkey,&rdquo; seizing an end, swung himself
up, and, amid the acclamations of the admiring
mob, began a new act of his performance.
The day was cold, and at that
dizzy height the wind struck bitterly
through the starved little overtaxed body;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
he lost his footing, caught wildly at the
rope, missed it, and&mdash;fell.</p>

<p>In that brief second did he see the old
mill and the little cabin standing in the
sunshine? Did he hear his mother&rsquo;s voice?
God knows. When a pitying hand gently
turned the little heap of quivering humanity,
a happy smile lit up the pinched face,
and the dying lips murmured, &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE HOG-FEEDER&rsquo;S DAY</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he cold gray light of early dawn
had given place to saffron, and
the first drowsy challenge from
the henroost had been shrilly
answered from far and near, when old man
Jerry awoke from his nap in the chimney
corner, and, finding himself chilled through
all his old, rheumatic bones, bent over the
dying embers, pushed together the blackened
and half-burned &ldquo;chunks,&rdquo; and blew
them until they glowed. Then, hitching his
stool close into the ashes, he spread his
horny palms to the blaze, and basked in
its genial warmth as it crackled up the wide
chimney. Reaching his pipe from its nook,
he filled it, dipped it skillfully in the coals
so as to ignite without wasting the precious
weed, and drew a long whiff by way
of a start; then, bending still closer to the
blaze, he pulled away, now and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
rubbing his shins in slow content, as though
to emphasize his comfort.</p>

<p>All things, though, must come to an end.
The &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; became a heap of white
ashes, the pipe was finished, and broad
shafts of light stealing down the chimney
and under the door told &ldquo;Ung Jerry&rdquo; that
it was time to be stirring.</p>

<p>He had, according to his usual custom,
risen from his bed long before cockcrow,
and, having cooked and eaten his &ldquo;morning
bread,&rdquo; had unlatched his door in order
to throw a morsel to his old hog-hound,
&ldquo;Drive,&rdquo; who had already crept from under
the house, and stood wagging his stump
of a tail in eager expectancy. The morsel
being thrown, the old man had cast a knowing
look towards the heavens, and, judging
by the seven stars that it yet lacked an
hour to dawn, had returned to the smoky
warmth and comfort of his hovel, where,
seated in the chimney nook, he had nodded
till roused by the crowings from all the
neighboring henroosts&mdash;for his cabin was
one of many.</p>

<p>The pipe being smoked, Ung Jerry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
rose stiffly, and, shuffling to his bed, fumbled
underneath it, and, taking care not to disturb
the setting hen, brought out two bits
of old blanket, with which he proceeded to
wrap his feet before putting on his shoes.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The hog-horn was now slung over the
old coat, a bucket of cold victuals was
reached from the shelf, and the old hog-feeder,
equipped for his day&rsquo;s work, lifted
the latch, and, stepping out into the sharp
frostiness of the November morning,
plodded with heavy steps toward the barnyard,
Drive following closely at his heels.</p>

<p>The frosty fields were glittering in the
slant rays of the newly risen sun, and sounds
of busy life came floating through the crisp
air, telling the old man that the day&rsquo;s labor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
had begun. The sharp crack of the teamster&rsquo;s
whip told that the great ox wagons
were already afield. The plow-boys
whistled as they led out their mules; men
and short-skirted, heavily shod women went
trooping to the cotton fields; the milkwomen
stepped briskly by, with the foaming
pails balanced upon their well-poised
heads. Then came the cowboys, with noisy
whoop, driving before them the crowding,
clumsy, sweet-breathed herd, while, fearlessly
amid all, pigeons fluttered, greedily
picking up the refuse grain, heedless of the
hoofs among which they pecked and fluttered.</p>

<p>One small, grizzled mule, of great age
and much cunning, had contrived to slip
into the feedroom, and was there enjoying
a stolen bait of oats when Ung Jerry
found her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;speck I wan&rsquo;t gwine fine you, I
reckon, but you &rsquo;se wrong dis time,&rdquo; he
said, taking her by one of the long ears and
leading her off to the barnyard, where the
little cart awaited her.</p>

<p>Drive, meanwhile, had crept under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
barn, where, nosing about, he had come upon
a hen&rsquo;s nest, and was feasting upon the warm,
fresh eggs.</p>

<p>The hitching-up was done with great
deliberation. Ung Jerry plodded to and
from the harness-room many times, bringing
out first a chuck collar, then a bit of
leather, finally, after a long search, an end
of rope. At length, when all seemed to be
adjusted, the old man again retired to the
harness-room, where he remained so long
that Drive was contemplating another raid
upon the hens, when he reappeared, bringing
with him an old piece of bagging, with
which he proceeded with careful adjustment
to protect the old mule&rsquo;s back from the
friction of the cart-saddle. She, meanwhile,
had stood with closed eyes and flopped ears,
immovable save for an occasional twitching
of her small, rat-like tail; but when
the loading began, her manner changed
from its quiescent indifference; watchful
glances followed each basketful that was
dumped in, and an ominous backing of the
ears gave warning of what would happen
should the load be heavier than she liked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
At length, all being ready for the start,
Ung Jerry climbed slowly to his perch
on the cart&rsquo;s edge, gave a jerk to the rope
bridle, and Rachel moved off, closely followed
by Drive, who, conscious of egg-sucking
and fearful of its consequences, had
prudently ensconced himself beneath the
cart, from whence he eyed, suspiciously, all
passers-by.</p>

<p>Slowly the little cart crept along the
narrow plantation lanes, crept past the level
cornfields and into the wide pasture, where
sunburnt mares were grazing with their
wild-eyed, unkempt colts; crept past the
marsh, where the heron, disturbed in her
solitary vigil, rose upon silent wing and
sought some more secluded haunt amid
the dim recesses of the swamp.</p>

<p>Turning at length into the forest, where
the gray moss hanging from the trees almost
obscured the deep blue autumnal
sky, the cart slowly creaked through the
rustling leaves until it came upon a cross
fence which barred the way. Here, as
Rachel came to a full stop, Ung Jerry awoke
from his nap, descended from his perch,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
and, unslinging his horn, blew one long
blast.</p>

<p>One was enough. In a moment the deep
stillness of the forest was broken by the
pattering of many little feet; from the
thickets the hogs came; each hurrying with
might and main to be foremost, they rushed,
grunting, squealing, crowding to the fence,
where, standing with upturned faces and
small covetous eyes, they awaited the feast of
golden grain which the old man hastened to
scatter amongst them. Then, leaning upon
the fence, he noted each greedy grunter as
he wriggled his small tail in keenest enjoyment
and cracked the sweet corn.</p>

<p>No need was there to count; to the hog-feeder
each animal possessed an individuality
so marked that in all the drove the
absence of the most insignificant was at
once detected. So now, as he leaned upon
the fence, he cast anxious glances into the
dimness beyond. Evidently some were
missing.</p>

<p>Drive, too, divining his master&rsquo;s thoughts,
stood with look intent and anxious yelp,
impatient for the search to begin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
Then the word came, &ldquo;Seek, boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrambling through the fence, he dashed
into every covert or tangle wherein a hog
might lurk, but without result; there came
no rush of feet, no shaking of the brown
leaves, no startled grunt. All was still,
save for the quick panting of the old
hound.</p>

<p>The old man then turned his eyes again
upon the greedy mob, still hoping to discover
the missing ones amongst them.
&rsquo;T was all in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De listed sow, <em>she</em> done gone, an&rsquo; de
big white <em>hogue</em>, <em>he</em> done gone, an&rsquo; seben
head o&rsquo; shotes!&rdquo; he at length murmured,
still, however, casting expectant glances
toward the thickets, in which Drive was
still sniffing with uneasy yelpings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seem like dem creturs is clean gone,
sho&rsquo; nuf,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an air of unwilling
conviction; then adding, &ldquo;well, ef
dey&rsquo;s gone, I &rsquo;se got &rsquo;em to fine, dat&rsquo;s de
trufe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He called in the dog, and, taking his
dinner bucket, climbed the fence and struck
off into the woods. Now and again he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
would pause, put his horn to his lips, and
give a long blast, then stand listening with
anxious expectancy. Every thicket was
searched. It was a weary tramp,&mdash;through
bogs and sloshes, where the cypress knees
stood up like sugar-loaves in the shallow
water, or sometimes his steps were bent
to some open glade, where the great oaks
dropped sweet mast among the brown
leaves.</p>

<p>The day was no longer young when a
low fence came into view; beyond it
stretched a levee, and at its base a glint of
water showed itself through the great trees,
which stretched their mighty arms as
though they would embrace it.</p>

<p>Ung Jerry, after climbing the fence,
mounted the levee and stood upon the brink
of a wide and muddy river. Taking off his
hat, the old man wiped the sweat from his
face, then turned an observant eye upon
the river, whose muddy waters were already
lapping the boughs of the overhanging
trees, and with a long-drawn breath exclaimed,
&ldquo;Bank an&rsquo; bank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as his experienced eye noted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
angry swirls near the shore and the d&eacute;bris
borne rapidly upon the turbid current, &ldquo;An&rsquo;
still on de rise. She gwine be out in de
low groun&rsquo;s befo&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;, bless de Lord;
I&rsquo;s been &rsquo;spectin&rsquo; she gwine play dis trick
eber since de win&rsquo; set like et did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, looking at the field of standing
corn upon the further shore, protected by
a low levee, and seeming to be upon a lower
level than the red waters of the flood, he
soliloquized:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s skeared de fresh gwine &rsquo;stroy a
sight o&rsquo; Mars Jones&rsquo;s corn. It raly do &rsquo;pear
like dat corn mout a been housed befo&rsquo;
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s thoughts were interrupted
at this point by loud and animated barkings
from Drive, and, hurrying to the spot
whence they proceeded, he discovered the
old hound standing in a broken gap in the
fence, in a state of excitement over the numerous
footprints which told that the truants
had broken through and made for the
river, evidently with designs upon &ldquo;Mars
Jones&rsquo;s&rdquo; cornfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s wha&rsquo; dey tuck de watah,&rdquo; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
old man remarked to the dog, as together
they followed the footprints to the water&rsquo;s
edge. &ldquo;Dat &rsquo;ere listed sow, she got mo&rsquo;
sense un folks! She know &rsquo;bout Mars
Jones&rsquo;s corn, an&rsquo; dey ain&rsquo;t no fence gwine
stop dat cretur when she take a notion for
to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, de listed sow, an&rsquo; de
big white hogue, an&rsquo; seben head o&rsquo; shotes
done tore down de fence, an&rsquo; took deyselves
&rsquo;cross de riber for to steal Mars Jones&rsquo;s
corn; I &rsquo;clare &rsquo;t is a disgrace. I reckon Mars
Jones gwine cuss a plenty when he fine it
out. It certinly is a pity for master&rsquo;s creturs
to do sich a low-life trick as dat. But
bless de Lord,&rdquo; and a look of crafty triumph
came into his face, &ldquo;dey&rsquo;s got dey bellies
full, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this pleasing reflection, and the
conviction that nothing more could be done
for the present, the old man seated himself
upon a log, opened his bucket, took
out his jack-knife, and proceeded to eat his
dinner, while Drive sat by, in eager readiness
to snatch the morsels flung to him,
ere they could reach the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
When the meal was finished, dog and
man each took comfort in his own way.
The dog stretched himself in the sunshine.
The old man sat with bent head
&ldquo;a-studyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; then nodded, then fell into
a deep sleep, soothed by the silence, which
reigned unbroken save for the distant cawing
of a crow.</p>

<p>The long gray moss swayed dreamily
upon the motionless boughs of the giant
trees. Where the sycamore lifted its
gaunt, white arms, the great bald eagle sat
immovable, watching with fierce, intent
gaze for its prey in the waters below.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The shadows were growing long upon
wood and river when the light dip of a
paddle broke upon the stillness, and old
Jerry, rousing from his nap, spied a canoe
gliding down stream, guided by two youths
who, with their guns lying crosswise upon
their knees, were making for the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mars Harry an&rsquo; Mars Phil,&rdquo; he murmured,
eying them with lazy curiosity, as
they brought their little craft to land, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
after making it fast, picked up their guns,
crossed the levee, and struck off into the
swamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey&rsquo;s after turkey, I &rsquo;speck; Mars
Harry an&rsquo; me, we&rsquo;s killed many a varmint
in dese here woods. Dey want no Mars
Phil &rsquo;bout here in dem days befo&rsquo; ole Mars
were tuck down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus soliloquizing, the old man continued
to gaze wistfully after the retreating
figures; for their appearance had seemed
to bring a disturbing element into his peaceful
dreams, and a look of helpless trouble
overspread his face as, taking off his hat
and slowly scratching his head, he murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seem like it mos&rsquo; a pity Mars Phil
trouble hisself for to come here, anyhow.
Well, well, well! we folks all gwine be
&rsquo;vided up &rsquo;twix Mars Harry an&rsquo; Mars Phil,
&rsquo;cause ole Mars, he not long for dis world!
Bless de Lord, whinsoever it please Him
for to teck ole Mars to hisself, I trus&rsquo; he
gwine &rsquo;vide off Jerry to Mars Harry&rsquo;s shere,
&rsquo;cause I nachally ain&rsquo;t got no use for t&rsquo;other
one&mdash;he too outlondesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
So saying, he rose and reached his bucket
from the bough where it hung. Drive, who
had for some moments been watching him
out of the corner of one red eye, rose also,
and the two set out upon their tramp back
to the cart.</p>

<p>The old man had climbed the fence, the
dog had scrambled through, and both were
threading their way across the swamp,
when the report of a gun close by caused
the dog to beat a retreat from the thicket
into which he had thrust his nose, and, with
tail tucked in, to creep to his master&rsquo;s side;
while the old man, exclaiming, &ldquo;Good Gor-a-mighty!
whot dat?&rdquo; pushed aside the
bushes in order to see what game the boys
had brought down.</p>

<p>The sight that met his eyes froze him
with horror. Philip&rsquo;s lifeless body lay upon
the ground, while Harry, with scared white
face, bent over it.</p>

<p>For a brief space the old man stood as if
petrified, then muttered: &ldquo;Jerry ain&rsquo;t gwine
know nothin&rsquo; bout dis here. When ole
Mars say, &lsquo;Jerry, what you seen in de Vine
Ridge Swash?&rsquo; Jerry, he gwine say,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
&lsquo;Nothin&rsquo;, Marster, fo&rsquo; de Lord. I seen nothin&rsquo;
&rsquo;t all!&rsquo; An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t gwine tell no lie, nuther,
&rsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t gwine look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus thinking, he cautiously drew back,
and, with ashen face and limbs that through
trembling almost failed to support him, he
stealthily crept away until out of earshot;
then took to his heels and fled. When,
however, he was forced to pause for breath,
he considered if he had done well to desert
his young master, and turned reluctantly to
retrace his steps, when, as he did so, the air
was suddenly rent with ear-piercing shrieks
for half a second, and Jerry&rsquo;s heart quailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s boun&rsquo; to be de debil,&rdquo; he whispered.
Then, a light seeming to break upon him,
he exclaimed: &ldquo;Bless God! &rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
but de ole Chieftain a-blowin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chieftain, a small freight steamer,
had recently taken the place of the old
flat-bottomed scows, and, as the steam
whistle was still a novelty, it is not surprising
that Ung Jerry, in his terror, should
for the moment have mistaken it for some
unearthly sound.</p>

<p>After many irresolute pauses, the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
man at length reached the scene of the
disaster, and with shaking hands thrust
aside the bushes. Except for the small
birds silently flitting to their roosts, the
place was utterly deserted. The level sunbeams
glinted through the gray moss,
gilded the tree trunks, and glowed crimson
upon the brown leaves; the solitary peace
of nature seemed unbroken; only the pool
of blood at Ung Jerry&rsquo;s feet told him
that what he had witnessed had not been a
vision.</p>

<p>After a moment&rsquo;s survey he was turning
away, when his eyes fell upon the two guns:
here, at least, was something tangible,
and the old man proceeded to secrete them
in the fallen leaves. Squatted upon the
ground, he was too busily engaged to note
the sound of approaching footsteps, and
started violently when a rough voice accosted
him. He mustered courage, however,
to quaver:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat you, Mars Jones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? of course it&rsquo;s me! Who did you
reckon it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Mars Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll know next time, if you
don&rsquo;t keep them hogs o&rsquo; yourn out of my
corn. Why, that confounded old sow can
destroy more corn in one night than you
are worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mars Jones, dat de trufe,&rdquo; meekly
assented the old man.</p>

<p>Mars Jones, warming to the subject, now
waxed more and more eloquent over his
grievances, until, having exhausted his pent
up wrath, he had leisure to observe old
Jerry&rsquo;s ashen face and shaking limbs, and
he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? are
you sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mars Jones, I&rsquo;s been po&rsquo;ly dis liblong
day, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; sassifrax for to make
me a little drap o&rsquo; tea, I&rsquo;s got sich a mis&rsquo;ry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sassafras!&rdquo; here broke in Mars Jones;
and, good-natured, despite his roughness,
he took from his pocket a <i>tickler</i>, and
handing Jerry a dram, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink this, you old blockhead. <em>Sassifrax</em>,
indeed!&mdash;what good you reckon sassifrax
goin&rsquo; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a scrape and a bow and a &ldquo;Thank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
ye, Marster,&rdquo; the old man gulped down the
dram, and Mars Jones, replacing his <i>tickler</i>,
was turning away, when his foot slipped in
something, and looking down he saw that
it was blood.</p>

<p>The dram had put so much heart into
the old man that he was able to reply
glibly to Mars Jones&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its jes&rsquo; wha&rsquo; I&rsquo;s been markin&rsquo; hogs,
Marster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you; I believe you&rsquo;ve
been killin&rsquo; one of your master&rsquo;s hogs&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;ve been at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as this did not concern him, he did
not wait to inquire further, and so, turning
on his heel, he strode off.</p>

<p>The hog-feeder, too, hastening away,
took the shortest path back to his cart.</p>

<p>The deserted barnyard lay silent in
the white moonlight when the little cart
creaked through the gate; but up at the
&ldquo;great house&rdquo; there were lights and movements
where the family watched the coming
of the boys.</p>

<p>Thursday, Friday, and Saturday passed
without tidings, and the hope that they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
been caught by the rising water and imprisoned
upon some isolated knoll had been
abandoned after the swamps had been
searched in every direction. To add to
the grief of the household, the master, already
enfeebled, now lay prostrated in a
condition that almost forbade hope.</p>

<p>Upon Sunday the waters began to abate,
fences again appeared, and patches of
drowned corn showed themselves above
the wastes of water, to the no small joy
of the flocks of blackbirds which chattered
and fluttered amongst them.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, tired of the loneliness of his
water-girt home, made his way to the
meeting-house, more for the sake of a gossip
with some of the neighbors than for the
day&rsquo;s preaching, and it was there that he
first heard the startling news of the unaccountable
disappearance of Squire Brace&rsquo;s
nephews.</p>

<p>In the excitement, each man was eager
to advance his own theory. The discussion
ended, however, in the general opinion that
their canoe had been swamped in the freshet
and the boys drowned, until a newcomer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
asserted that the canoe, with Phil&rsquo;s overcoat
still in it, had been found tied up at the
Vine Ridge landing, and that their guns
had been discovered hidden in the leaves
at no great distance in the swamp.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, Mr. Jones could but
call to mind his meeting with the hog-feeder,
his strange behavior, and the blood
upon the ground, and he at once jumped
to the conclusion that old Jerry had been
at least a party to some foul deed. His
suspicions, once made known, became certainties,
and the whole party, hastily mounting
their horses, rode off to the nearest
justice, their convictions gaining ground so
rapidly that, ere the house of the justice
was reached, poor, simple old Jerry, the
most harmless of God&rsquo;s creatures, had become
in their estimation a villain of the
deepest dye.</p>

<p>Upon this identical Sunday morning the
old hog-feeder betook himself to the little
plantation church, whose bell, with cracked
clamor, gave warning that preaching was
about to begin.</p>

<p>The frosty brightness of the past week
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
had given place to a soft mist, through whose
dimness the pale sunbeams looked sadly
upon the autumnal world; and as the old
man, dressed in his Sunday clothes, plodded
along the path, the tiny crickets from beneath
the grass sent up their sad, perpetual
dirge.</p>

<p>Men and women, all shining with Sabbath
cleanness, came straggling toward the
church, silently and soberly, without the
usual light-hearted laughter, for the trouble
at the &ldquo;great house&rdquo; was felt by all the
little band. Yet their feelings were not without
a mixture of pleasurable excitement,
for all were anticipating with gloomy satisfaction
the lengthy prayers, the groanings,
and the head-shakings upon this mournful
day.</p>

<p>The congregation had taken their seats,
old Jethro had taken his place in the pulpit,
the long-drawn cadence of the funeral hymn
had floated sadly up to the &ldquo;great house,&rdquo;
when a noise at the door startled the congregation,
who, turning, beheld standing
in the door a group of white men. Among
them was the overseer, who, coming forward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
announced that hog-feeder Jerry was to be
arrested upon a charge of murder. &ldquo;Not
that I believe it, men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the law
must take its course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime two others had approached
the old man, who had already
stumbled to his feet, and, while bowing in
a dazed kind of way, kept murmuring,
&ldquo;Sarvent, Marsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Handcuffs were put upon him, and amid
a profound silence he was led forth and lifted
into a cart. The two sheriffs took their
places upon each side of him, and the cort&egrave;ge
moved off.</p>

<p>The people, having sufficiently recovered
from their shock to jostle one another out
of the building, stood huddled together like
a flock of frightened sheep; but when the
cavalcade had driven off, a subdued clamor
of voices arose, all unanimous in contempt
for &ldquo;dese here po&rsquo; white, who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; knowed
better &rsquo;n to come meddlin&rsquo; long o&rsquo; Marster&rsquo;s
folks ef Marster wan&rsquo;t down on de bed an&rsquo;
mos&rsquo; like to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That the dull and simple brain of the
old man should have been capable of any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
formulated plan is not to be imagined, and
when upon the following day he was taken
before the justice for examination, he merely
acted from an instinct of affection in
shielding his young master, even at the
risk of his own life. When questioned, he
preserved an obstinate silence; then, when
forced to speak, denied having seen either
of the boys upon the day of their disappearance,
but, when cross-questioned, admitted
that he had seen Mars Phil in the Vine
Ridge woods; and finally, when taxed
with the blood upon the ground and with
having hidden the guns, he reluctantly admitted
that &ldquo;ef Mars Phil had been hurted&rdquo;
he had done it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do with the body?&rdquo; questioned
the justice; &ldquo;throw it in the river?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur from the prisoner, which
passed for assent, concluded the examination,
and the justice, sorely puzzled, committed
him to jail to await his trial.</p>

<p>With the early morning, the country
people had begun to gather around the
courthouse, and when told that the old
miscreant had actually confessed to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
murder, their innate love of justice gave
place to fierce anger; and when the prisoner,
gray with terror, bent and tottering,
was led forth, he was surrounded by a silent
but determined crowd, who, thrusting the
sheriffs aside, seized and drove him before
them, and had already slipped the noose
about his neck, when an inarticulate shout
caused the crowd to sway,&mdash;a horseman
dashed into their midst and proclaimed
that both boys were alive. Their disappearance
had been explained on that morning
by a letter forwarded by hand, which ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="addressr">On Board the Chieftain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;This afternoon, while
hunting in the Vine Ridge woods, Phil&rsquo;s
gun went off and wounded him in the side.
I was at my wit&rsquo;s end what to do, when I
heard the Chieftain blow up the river; so
I tore off to the levee, where I was lucky
enough to succeed in attracting Captain
Smith&rsquo;s attention, who sent off a boat, and
we managed to get Phil on board. I
wanted Smith to put back to our landing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
but he thought the current too strong; and
on the whole, I believe it is better for Phil
to keep on to Hilton, as it would be impossible
to get a doctor at home in this high
water. Phil&rsquo;s hurt is not very serious, I hope.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">Your dutiful nephew,</p>
<p class="sig">Harry Brace.</p>
</div>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the day succeeding Harry&rsquo;s homecoming,
he entered the room designated the
&ldquo;study,&rdquo; in which the Squire was usually
to be found when indoors.</p>

<p>The room probably owed the name of
&ldquo;study&rdquo; to a set of <i>Farmer&rsquo;s Magazines</i>
which, in all the dignity of expensive bindings,
divided the shelf with a rather damaged
edition of &ldquo;The Turf Register,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Farrier&rsquo;s Manual,&rdquo; a brace of antiquated
medical works, and a stack of newspapers.
Fishing tackle, a cupping apparatus, a set
of engineering instruments, half a dozen
ears of extra fine seed corn, medicine scales,
and a huge cotton stock filled the rest of
the bookcase.</p>

<p>The Squire, seated before a blazing fire,
in the lazy comforts of convalescence, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
pipe and tobacco at his elbow, presented a
not unenviable picture when contrasted with
the wintry grayness outside.</p>

<p>Harry, who had been greatly touched by
the old hog-feeder&rsquo;s affectionate fidelity, now
sought his uncle in order to beg that as a
recompense he might be given his freedom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; exclaimed the Squire; &ldquo;why,
confound it, my dear boy, what would he
do with freedom, if he had it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he would like it,&rdquo; Harry murmured,
a little sheepishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s as free as air now; a deuced
sight freer than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless Harry gained his point,
and though the Squire growled, &ldquo;You
young jackanapes, you&rsquo;ve robbed me of
the best hog-feeder on the river,&rdquo; still he was
evidently pleased, and in the evening old
Jerry was sent for.</p>

<p>When, in answer to the summons, Jerry
presented himself at the study door, his
master said to him, with a stateliness fitted
to the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry, I have sent for you to tell you
that your young master here, as a reward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
for your fidelity, desires to give you your
freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the Squire paused, and Jerry, not
knowing what else to say, said, &ldquo;Yes, Marster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry, standing by, was feeling rather
wrought up, while the Squire, also somewhat
excited, continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you a house in the free settlement,
out in the slashes, and your young
master will always take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another rather disconcerting pause was
broken by a second &ldquo;Yes, Marster;&rdquo; and the
old man, picking up his hat, shuffled out.</p>

<p>The Squire glanced at Harry with a mischievous
twinkle in his eyes, but the boy&rsquo;s
face expressed such blank disappointment
that he took pity upon him, and, picking
up a newspaper, dismissed the matter.</p>

<p>Upon the following evening a low knock
was heard at the study door, then a fumbling
at the latch, and old Jerry once more
stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, what is it now?&rdquo; his master
asked kindly. &ldquo;Come, out with it!&rdquo; he
repeated, as the old man, with a feeble grin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
stood helplessly fingering his hat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And old Jerry, slowly scratching his head,
made answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank, Marster; I&rsquo;s come to ax Marster
what I done to &rsquo;splease Mars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Displease me! Why, what has put that
notion into your head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Mars, what I&rsquo;s done, but I&rsquo;s
skeared Mars mout be set agin me, &rsquo;cause
he say he gwine sen&rsquo; me offen de plantation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Harry explained that he was to be
set free, and eagerly enlarged upon the delights
of liberty. The hog-feeder listened,
but was unmoved: he obstinately declined
to accept his freedom, his plea being that
&ldquo;the varments&rdquo; would &ldquo;&rsquo;stroy up his creeturs&rdquo;
if he were not there to look after
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De black sow, she got a fine litter o&rsquo;
pigs now, an&rsquo; de foxes is a&rsquo;ter &rsquo;em de
blessed time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this no more could be urged, and
Jerry, scraping his foot, went out with a
mind full of content.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> As this is a true tale of an old-time plantation
negro, I think it but fair to state that he had a &ldquo;chist&rdquo;
full of good clothes; but, with a parsimony not uncommon
among his race, he preferred to protect his
feet with old bits of blanket, instead of using the
excellent home-knit woollen socks which lay snugly
hidden away in his &ldquo;chist;&rdquo; and it was the same feeling
which caused him to wrap himself now into an
old garment made up of patches, although three good
ones lay snugly folded away in the same chest.</p></div>

<h2>THE JUNIOR RESERVE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapir"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>t was in the early summer of
1864 that the family at Swan
Manor was thrown off its balance
by the calling out of &ldquo;The
Junior Reserves.&rdquo; That unfledged boys,
and among them their own little smooth-cheeked
Billy, should be called upon to fill
up the thinned and broken ranks of the
Southern army filled their hearts with dismay.
The old Squire, with bushy brows
beetling over his eyes, sat in grief too deep
for words, a prey to the darkest forebodings.
Miss Jemima had wept until her eyes were
mere nothings, while her nose, coming gallantly
to the front, had assumed an undue
prominence. Kate, with her pretty lips
drawn to keep down the rising sobs, tried
all in vain to bestow upon her twin brother
bright looks and smiles, ever before so ready
and spontaneous. In the early secession
days it had seemed such fun to ride to dress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
parade and toss bouquets to the laughing
&ldquo;boys in gray,&rdquo; while all the world played
Dixie!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Away down South in Dixie.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>How she and Billy had whispered and
plotted, and how great the triumph when
together they climbed the gate-post and,
after much toil, successfully planted their
little red and white flag! But now, alas! all
was changed,&mdash;they were fast getting to
be grown-up people, and now her own dear
Billy must go to help drive the Yankees
out of Dixie.</p>

<p>As for Billy himself, a suppressed but
exultant grin shone upon his face, a trifle
deprecating when in the presence of his
grandfather or his tearful Aunt Jemima,
but very jubilant despite these drawbacks.
In truth this junior reserve was only too
pleased to exchange the Latin grammar for
the musket, and little cared he for prospective
hardships, provided school were not
among them.</p>

<p>In the few busy days before the departure,
Kate followed Billy&rsquo;s footsteps, trying
in vain to share his elation. &ldquo;Good gracious,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
Kate,&rdquo; he would exclaim, when he discovered
her furtively wiping her eyes with her little
damp ball of a pocket handkerchief, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
be such a little goose; why, what would you
have a fellow do? I had no idea that you
were that sort of a girl.&rdquo; Then, as between
laughing and crying her face contorted itself
into a sort of spasmodic grin, he would
say: &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s the way to do,
if you&rsquo;ll just cheer up, I&rsquo;ll be all right; the
Yankees&rsquo;ll not bother me much, you bet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the request of Serena (Billy&rsquo;s former
nurse) her boy Cy was chosen to accompany
his young master as body servant, one of
his chief recommendations being that, naturally
&ldquo;skeary,&rdquo; he would be a safe companion;
also, as his mother proudly averred,
he was the fastest runner upon the plantation.</p>

<p>It was upon a golden evening in June
that little Billy bade farewell to his home,
Miss Jemima and Kate going with him to
the little wayside station. Cy, gotten up
in great style, followed, while the rear was
brought up by a motley procession,&mdash;all
eager for the honor of carrying some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
belongings. The Squire, with Don the old
Irish setter, stood in the doorway until
Billy passed out of sight; then the two
together, the old man and the old dog, went
back into the silent house.</p>

<p>The path to the station wound its way
through a field of ripening wheat, from
whence the clear whistle of a partridge
smote sharply though the fervid air. Billy
paused, and, pointing to a tangle of blackberry,
exclaimed: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nest there
as sure as shooting, and I&rsquo;ll go there to-mor&mdash;&rdquo;
A quick catching of the breath cut
short the unfinished words, and the boy,
with lips slightly drawn, quickened his pace.
Kate, choking down her sobs, held his hand
in her tight clasp, as she kept pace with his
hurried step. Miss Jemima, steadying her
voice, remarked with a sprightly air that
there would be fine shooting when he
should come back in the autumn. Then
the little station came into view, looking
very empty and deserted; two men loading
a flat car were the only living objects to be
seen. They paused in their work to greet
Billy, and ask where he was off to. It seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
so strange a thing to Kate that all the world
did not know.</p>

<p>The train was not on time, and the waiting
became so painful that it was almost
with gladness that they heard the warning
whistle far down the track. A small crowd
had gradually collected, and some one remarked:
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s blowin&rsquo; for the bridge.
It&rsquo;ll be ten minutes before she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
To the tumultuously throbbing hearts of
the little party it was a positive relief when
a puff of smoke was seen and the engine
came rushing around the bend. Then there
were hurried kisses; the bell clanged, a
voice called out, &ldquo;All aboard,&rdquo; and the train
was off. &ldquo;Gone, gone, gone,&rdquo; Kate repeated
over and over to herself, as she gazed with
tearless eyes into the dim distance of the
now silent track.</p>

<p>As the party retraced their steps homeward
the partridge was still calling his
cheerful &ldquo;Bob White&rdquo; from amid the wheat,
while from the shadowy depth of a laurel
thicket came the sweet gurgle of the wood-thrush.</p>

<p>In the late summer, news&mdash;glorious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
news&mdash;came that the foe had been driven
back, and their boy was unhurt.</p>

<p>Later, a man from the front at home on
furlough was heard to say that &ldquo;Billy
Swan was a regular trump, and had borne
himself like a veteran.&rdquo; Kate walked elate,
saying the words over and over, with a proud
smile, &ldquo;A hero, a regular trump,&rdquo;&mdash;he, her
own dear Billy. The old Squire, too, with
ill-concealed pride in his boy, was once more
like his former self.</p>

<p>Happy days&mdash;brief, hopeful days! Alas,
alas! Many Junes have come and gone since
little Billy was laid to rest in the old burying-ground,
close to the wheat-field where
the partridge calls, calls, the long day
through. June roses scatter their leaves
above him, and when the sun drops low, with
long golden shafts upon the green mound
which covers him, from far down in the
laurel thicket comes the liquid gurgle of
the wood-thrush. Kate looks into faces,
once frank and bright, and full of youth
and hope, now grown old and seamed with
care, and she tells herself that &ldquo;whom the
gods love, die young.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MAMMY</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>wo little snub noses were flattening
themselves against the
nursery window pane, while
the four eager eyes watched
the soft flakes whirling through the air and
silently descending upon the whitening
earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sposen we was to steal out,&rdquo; whispered
the boy, &ldquo;an&rsquo; hide, so Mammy couldn&rsquo;t
never find us no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An excited chuckle interrupted the further
development of this deliciously lawless
scheme; but, though the little sister caught
the infection, she prudently turned from
the tempting prospect, saying, &ldquo;No, Sed,
I&rsquo;s &rsquo;fraid you might git the croups an&rsquo;
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other occupants of the room were a
little roly-poly cherub of a girl, seated in a
tiny chair, holding in her arms a rag baby,
which she rocked and dangled in servile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
imitation of her mammy, who, with bumpings
peculiar to the nursery chair, was
rocking to sleep a still younger babe. A
fair little maiden, curled up comfortably
upon a cushion, the firelight glistening
upon her yellow locks, bent over a book,
from which she read, in high-pitched, childish
voice, to her mammy, the story of &ldquo;Ellen
Lynn.&rdquo; Mammy was very proud that
her nursling could read, and would cast admiring
looks upon the child as she bent
over her book, with finger pointing to each
word. Both were absorbed in the story,
and every picture was examined with
scrupulous care.</p>

<p>Another occupant of the nursery was
&ldquo;Chany,&rdquo; the under nursemaid. Gawky,
sleek, and black, she sat flat upon the floor,
her large, well-shod feet turned to the fire,
a picture of lazy, vacant content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ch-Ch-Chany,&rdquo; stuttered Mammy, &ldquo;look
in de top drawer an&rsquo; git a hankcher and
blow dat chile&rsquo;s nose. Go on wid yo book,
honey; Mammy ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; &rsquo;sturb you no
mo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lynn left the sleigh, and turning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
from the island&rdquo;&mdash;piped little Caroline.
Then there came another prolonged snuffle
from Sedley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Ch-Ch-Chany, why&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you git
dat hankcher?&rdquo; caused that languid maiden
to bestir herself. Having fumbled in the
drawer for the handkerchief, she approached
the window, but no sooner did the little boy
become aware of her intention than, with a
rebellious shake of his curly head, he buried
his nose in his little chapped fists, and, regardless
of Sibyl&rsquo;s advice, that he had better
be good, he firmly stood his ground, determined
to resist Chany to the death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t gwine let me tetch him,&rdquo; said
Chany, feebly dabbing at him with the
handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, pray, gal, don&rsquo;t be so no-&rsquo;count,&rdquo;
Mammy answered. Then Chany, stung by
the imputation, made another helpless dive;
a scuffle ensued, in which she was utterly
routed, and the victorious Sedley threw
himself upon Mammy&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; me de hankcher,&rdquo; said Mammy,
with an air of withering contempt. &ldquo;There,
now, you done woke up your little brother,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
she said, when, the nose being blown, she
again returned to trying to jolt baby Joe to
sleep. &ldquo;He jest had drapped off into a
doze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, chilluns, le&rsquo;s pop some corn!&rdquo;
Chany now exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a whole
sight of it,&rdquo; she went on, as she searched a
basket, which she had unearthed from the
closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! pop corn!&rdquo; shouted Sedley and
Sibyl, running, and each seizing an ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! pop torn!&rdquo; echoed the cherub,
throwing down her rag baby. So the
shovel was run into the ashes, and Chany
and the three little ones set to work to
shell the corn.</p>

<p>Quiet was again restored, and Caroline,
who, all through the hubbub, had kept her
finger faithfully upon &ldquo;island,&rdquo; continued
her reading.</p>

<p>Mammy now substituted a sideways
movement of the knees for the more vigorous
bumping of the chair, and baby Joe&mdash;lying
luxuriously upon her wide lap&mdash;gazed
dreamily into the glowing coals upon
the hearth, until gradually the white lids
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
drooped over the blue eyes, and he slept.
The nursery was very quiet now. The
corn-poppers were intent upon their work,
and Mammy, soothed by the unwonted stillness,
listened drowsily to the little reader
until fresh interest was excited by the following
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men were now still more alarmed,&rdquo;
read Caroline. &ldquo;Farmer Lynn said that he
would go with them and see what had become
of Mr. Lynn and Annie. The whole
party accordingly went back to the river.
After searching about for some time, one of
the men espied something black on the surface
of the snow, at a great distance down
the river. They all proceeded to the spot,
and were dreadfully shocked on arriving
there to find that the black spot was a part
of Mr. Lynn&rsquo;s arm and that his body was
beneath, frozen, and buried up in the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mammy heard these words, she
threw up her arms, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Lord,
have mercy &rsquo;pon my soul! What! Mr. Lynn
hisself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her imagination Mr. Lynn was a most
real person. The book was now brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
to her and she, with little Caroline, looked
with deep and mournful interest at the picture
of the empty sleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is a awful country to live
in; seem like it ain&rsquo;t fitten for a dog, much
less white folks. To think o&rsquo; Mr. Lynn hisself
bein&rsquo; froze to death. Well! well! well!
It certainly was onexpected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children&rsquo;s story books furnished
Mammy with many thoughts. Among them
was a set of German nursery tales, full of
quaint colored pictures, in which she took
especial pleasure. Seated by the nursery
fire, the baby asleep in his crib and the
others out at play, she would turn the leaves
feeling that each picture was a living portrait.
Slovenly Peter, Rocking Phillip, and
Greedy Jacob were her favorites. Once
when shown a pretzel, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Ef
it ain&rsquo;t the very thing what Jacob had in
his hand when he busted,&rdquo; and, taking the
pretzel in her hand, she contemplated it
with a thoughtful and sentimental air.</p>

<p>The nursery door was now burst open,
and in rushed Harry, bringing with him a
blast of fresh cold air; black Ned came too,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
and both brought upon their feet enough
snow to cover the carpet with moist tracks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Ne-Ne-Ned, ain&rsquo;t you got no mo&rsquo;
manners than to be a-tracking up de house
dis way? Go &rsquo;long out and clean your
feet;&rdquo; but the hubbub was too great for
Mammy&rsquo;s words to be heeded; pig-tails
were being brandished aloft, and the children
all clustered round Harry and Ned,
asking questions and clamoring for pig-tails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somefin
better&rsquo;n pig-tails,&rdquo; and he drew from his
pocket the mangled remains of a dozen or
more snow-birds.</p>

<p>A scramble now ensued, and Sibyl&mdash;having
secured as many as she wanted&mdash;retired
to a corner, and silently fell to
plucking them, while Sedley, who was as
vainglorious as a Comanche, capered about
on his short legs, and boasted of imaginary
exploits with trap and dead-fall.</p>

<p>Caroline looked on, half pleased and half
disgusted, keeping herself clear of contact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Calline she too proud to tetch pig-tails,&rdquo;
grinned Chany.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
&ldquo;&rsquo;F cose she is,&rdquo; Mammy answered, bridling.
She was very vain of Miss Caroline&rsquo;s
daintiness.</p>

<p>The baby was now laid in his crib.
Chany was dispatched for salt and pepper;
the shovel was again run into the ashes,
pig-tails were placed delicately upon the
coals, and the nursery, pervaded with the
various odors of wet shoes, burnt corn, fried
grease, etc., was given up to disorder and
cooking, into which Mammy threw herself
with as much zest as did the children. The
pig-tails were broiled to a turn, and the
small birds were frizzling away upon the
shovel, when Sedley, taking advantage of
his opportunity, made a rush for the door,
opened it, and was outside, with mouth
and hands full of snow. Before Mammy&rsquo;s
vigilant eye had noted his escape, he was
flying back in triumph, with a big ball in
his fist, when she met him and, with dexterous
grasp, wrenched it from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Di-di-did anybody ever see your match!&rdquo;
she exclaimed as she hurled the ball into
the fire. &ldquo;I clar I&rsquo;s got a good mind to
take you right straight to your ma.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
But Sedley knew the value of such
threats and soon wiggled himself out of
her grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Da now, go &rsquo;long an&rsquo; &rsquo;have yourself,&rdquo; she
said, with admiring fondness, as he laughed
and capered away from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honey, what is you a-doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she now
inquired of Sibyl, who, with hot cheeks, was
bending over a pile of coals. &ldquo;Cookin&rsquo; a
bird? Let me do it,&mdash;you&rsquo;s a-burnin&rsquo; your
little face clean to a cracklin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mammy, I&rsquo;m cookin&rsquo; my bird for
grandma,&rdquo; the child answered, rejecting all
help, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do it all by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh&rsquo;, baby honey, your gran&rsquo;ma ain&rsquo;t
comin&rsquo; before Christmas eve, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s a
week off. Your bird ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; keep all
dat time, but ne&rsquo; mine, I&rsquo;ll make Ned
ketch you another one.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Upon Christmas Eve, the children might
have been seen at the big gate, straining
their eyes down the road, each hoping to
be the first to see their grandmother&rsquo;s carriage.
Visions of waxen dolls, sugar-plums,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
and other vague delights imparted a double
zest to her arrival,&mdash;to say nothing of
Uncle Robin (the driver) who, in the estimation
of the little boys, was of far greater
importance than was their grandmother.
To them he was an oracle of wisdom, and
their delight was to follow him about the
stable lot or to sit in the sunshine and
hang upon his words; for his imagination
was fertile, and the boys would listen with
wonder to the tales of his prowess and skill
with horses. Something was now observed
to be moving far down the road, which
soon proved to be the carriage. Yes, there
were &ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peacock,&rdquo; which no
one but Uncle Robin could handle, and
there sat Uncle Robin upon the box, and
there was grandma inside, smiling and
waving her handkerchief, and there, too,
sat Aunt Polly, grandma&rsquo;s maid.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped, and Uncle Robin,
bowing and smiling, descended and opened
the door, and they all scrambled in and
were hugged and kissed, and Polly admired
their beauty and exclaimed at their
growth. Then the door was clapped to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
again, but not before Harry had managed
to slip out and clamber to the box beside
Uncle Robin, who, having driven through
the gate, handed him the reins, with a
caution to keep his eye upon Peacock. In
the estimation of the boy, this sleek and
overfed Peacock seemed little less than a
raging lion whom only Uncle Robin could
quell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run in a minute, if he gits a
chance,&rdquo; said the guileful Uncle Robin.
So Harry clutched the reins and drove
proudly past the lot, in full view of some
of the men, turned in at the yard gate, and
drew up before the door.</p>

<p>Grandma could not wait for the hanging
of the Christmas stockings, but insisted
upon opening her trunk at once,
and displaying her gifts to the children&rsquo;s
delighted eyes. The wax babies exceeded
their wildest hopes. The house was made
horrible with horns and drums. Mammy
laughed and showed her dimples and courtesied
over her own gorgeous present, and
all felt that Christmas had really come.</p>

<p>For several days, indeed, throughout the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
holidays, Harry felt that he had left childhood
far behind him, and, as he strutted
about the stable yard, he now and then expectorated,
in imitation of Uncle Robin,
as though he had a quid in his mouth.</p>

<p>Aunt Polly, though far inferior to Uncle
Robin in the children&rsquo;s estimation, was
yet a person of distinction, and no naughtiness
was ever displayed when she was by
to witness it.</p>

<p>Mammy usually enjoyed a gossip with
Aunt Polly over the nursery fire. But,
sometimes feelings of coolness would arise.
Polly belonged to the family of the mother
of the children, while Mammy came from
that of the father, and between the two a
slight rivalry had always existed as to the
superiority of her own white children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T is a pity Miss Calline&rsquo;s back&rsquo;s so
round,&rdquo; said Polly one night as the children
were being undressed.</p>

<p>Now, if there was a feature in which
Mammy took a pride, it was in the straightness
of the children&rsquo;s limbs and the flatness
of their backs, above all the limbs and
backs in the other branches of the family;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
so, firing up at once, she replied that she
would like to see a flatter back than &ldquo;this
here one,&rdquo; laying her hand upon Caroline&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Emmaline&rsquo;s is a sight flatter,&rdquo;
Polly stoutly maintained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got as
pretty shape as ever I see,&mdash;all our people&rsquo;s
got good shapes from old Missis
down. I reckon this chile&rsquo;s got her back
from her pa&rsquo;s fambly.&rdquo; When Polly said
this, Mammy felt that the gauntlet had
been flung down, and, at once, with an eloquence
all her own, so defended the &ldquo;shapes&rdquo;
of her &ldquo;fambly&rdquo; that Polly was fairly beaten
in the war of words, and was forced to admit,
with many apologies, that Miss Caroline&rsquo;s
back was as flat as Miss Emmaline&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Mammy accepted the apology with some
hauteur, and it was several days before entire
cordiality was re&euml;stablished; in fact,
in all her after life, Mammy would, when
in certain moods, hark back to &ldquo;dat time
when dat long-mouthed Polly had de imperdence
to say dat our folks&rsquo; backs weren&rsquo;t
as straight as hern.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
Full of peaceful content were the lives
of both whites and blacks. Merrily the
Christmas went by, to be followed by
others as merry, and the winters and summers
came and went, turning childhood
into maturity and maturity into old age.
Mammy&rsquo;s glory reached its zenith when, at
&ldquo;Miss Calline&rsquo;s&rdquo; grand wedding, she herself
rustled about in all the grandeur of a new
black silk and Polly was forever squelched.
The whole world seemed full of prosperity,
abundance, and careless happiness, when
suddenly, like a thunderbolt, the war came.</p>

<p>The plantation home was abandoned
very carelessly, and with light hearts the
family drove away, expecting nothing but
to return with the frosts of winter. They
refugeed to a farmhouse upon the outskirts
of a little up-country village.</p>

<p>Sedley, though still a beardless youth,
shouldered his musket, and took his place
in the ranks. Sibyl and her mother, in the
little rude farmhouse, thought not of their
lost splendor, but cheerfully looked for the
good days sure to come when, the war over,
the dear ones would come back, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
old times. Every Southern woman knows
how it was when the great battles were
fought and a trembling, white-lipped group
of women and aged men would stand huddled
together to hear what the midnight
dispatches might have in store for them.</p>

<p>In the little upland village the refugees
were closely knit together by hopes and
fears in common. When sorrow fell upon
one household the little community all
mourned. But if the wires brought glad
words that all at the front were unharmed,
there would come a period of happy reaction;
the little society would be wildly gay,
especially if one or more young heroes
from the front had come home with a
slight wound,&mdash;just enough to make a
demigod of him.</p>

<p>Such was Sedley&rsquo;s happy fate one never-to-be-forgotten
summer, when every girl in
the village fell madly in love with his blue
eyes and his gray coat and his mustache
and his lovely voice, as he strummed the
guitar in the moonlight,&mdash;and most of all
with his merry laugh. Did time permit, I
might tell of such odd costumes, such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
make-ups of homespun and lace, fine old
silks and calicoes, in which the Dixie girls
danced so merrily.</p>

<p>It was just upon the heels of one of these
happy seasons that a rumor was whispered
that the army was about to fall back and
that the offices and stores would be removed
in consequence. At first the rumor was rejected,&mdash;no
good Confederate would listen
to such treason; but finally the croakers
were proved to be right. The government
stores were hastily removed. The office-holders
took a sad farewell of those whom
they left behind them, and the little town
was abandoned to its fate, outside the Confederate
lines.</p>

<p>Sibyl and her mother were among the
tearful group who watched the little band
of departing friends, as it passed out of the
town, waved a last adieu, and strained their
dimmed eyes for a last sight of the Confederate
gray, ere they went sadly back to their
homes.</p>

<p>When Sibyl and her mother reached
home, they found Mammy already at work.
She had ripped open a feather bed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
amid its downy depths she was burying
whatever she could lay her hands upon.
Clothing, jewelry, even a china ornament
or two,&mdash;all went in. It was a day or two
after that Rita complained of a great knot
in her bed, which had bruised her back
and prevented her sleeping. Mammy
heard her, but, waiting until they were
alone, said in a half whisper, &ldquo;Honey, I
knows what dat knot is, &rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but
your brother&rsquo;s cavalry boots that I hid in
the bed. I reckon the feathers has got
shuck down. Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
turn your bed over, and then you won&rsquo;t
feel &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;, honey, do pray be kereful
how you talks before Jim. I ain&rsquo;t got no
&rsquo;pinion o&rsquo; Jim, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll never do in de
world to let him speck where the things is
hid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one knew how soon the Yankees
might come, and all were busily engaged
in concealing whatever they had of value.
People may smile now at some of the recollections
of that day, but they were earnest
enough then, and as much importance was
attached to the concealment of a ham or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
pound of black sugar as to that of a casket
of diamonds. Clothing and provisions
were hidden in various strange and out-of-the-way
places, and, when night came,
Mammy and her mistress were glad to rest
their tired bodies, although too much excited
to sleep. At last, however, a deep sleep fell
upon them, from which they were awakened
by the distant roar of cannon. The
village, though no longer a depot for Confederate
stores, was not to be given up without
a struggle. It now became a sort of
debatable ground, and cannonading, more
or less distant, told the anxious listeners of
almost daily skirmishes.</p>

<p>Awakened by the cannon&rsquo;s roar, Sibyl
opened the window and listened. A pale
glory to the eastward, a low rustle of leaves,
a drowsy chirp from tiny nests, all merging
into one inarticulate murmur of awakening
nature, told that night was over. Sibyl and
her mother hastily dressed themselves, called
Rita from her fearless young sleep, roused
up the baby, as they still called little Joe;
then asked themselves why they did it.
There was nothing to do but to sit on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
porch or to wander aimlessly, listening with
beating hearts to the faint and more faint
boom of the artillery. And the roses glowed
in the May sunshine, and the honeysuckle
wafted its perfume in at the open windows,
and the bees droned among the flowers, and
all was so peaceful, but for the incessant
dull roar of the battle.</p>

<p>The Confederates were finally driven
back, the Federals entered the town, and
then the bummers came streaming through
the country, leaving desolation behind them.
Cattle, poultry, everything eatable was
driven off or carried away in the great
army wagons that came crashing along, regardless
of all obstacles in their cruel course.
Cut off from all news from the army, Sibyl
and her mother dragged wearily through
the long, sad summer, and the two children
grew gaunt for want of nourishing food.</p>

<p>It was a morning in the early autumn
that Sibyl, sitting at work by an open window,
became suddenly conscious of an unusual
presence near her, and, looking up,
beheld a man gazing fixedly upon her. A
party of Federals had that very morning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
visited the house upon a pretended search
for concealed weapons, and the girl, with
nerves still vibrating with terror, uttered a
little shriek, and, starting up, was about to
close the window, when the figure leaped
over the low sill, a pair of strong arms
encircled her, kisses fell upon her lips, and,
ere the shriek of terror could find voice,
she recognized, under the rough countryman&rsquo;s
hat, the laughing eyes of her brother
Sedley.</p>

<p>Such meetings can be better imagined
than described; seconds had become minutes
ere Sibyl or her mother could begin
to realize their joy, which, in its first intensity,
was almost pain. Then came the
breathless questionings as to the well-being
of the other dear ones, then the deep sigh
of thankfulness from the long-burdened
hearts.</p>

<p>At the sound of a strange voice. Mammy,
peeping in at the open door, had fallen
prostrate with joy, and, while hugging her
boy to her faithful bosom, had called upon
her Maker to testify that upon this very
morning the scissors had stuck up twice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I knowed when dey done dat, dat
somebody was a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dinah, the cook, came in, courtesying
and laughing and loyal as though no
emancipating army had set foot in Dixie.</p>

<p>When the joyful tidings had reached the
children, Rita&rsquo;s thin legs might have been
seen flying through the high grass. The
more practical Joe toiled behind, bending
under the burden of (their treasure trove)
a big pumpkin, a basket of persimmons,
and a few stalks of sorghum, for, like the
Scriptural colts of the wild ass, they passed
their time in searching after every green
thing.</p>

<p>In the magnetism of the bright presence
of the young soldier, all the sad forebodings
seemed to vanish into thin air.
While listening to his brave words of hope,
they forgot that the sunny hours of this
most happy day were hastening by. Already
the shadows lay long upon the grass,
and there remained yet so much to be
said and so little time wherein to say it!
By set of sun Sedley must be on his way
to rejoin his command. His brief and daring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
visit had been achieved by his assuming
a disguise before venturing inside the
enemy&rsquo;s lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you ever manage it?&rdquo; asked
the mother. &ldquo;I tremble when I think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it was easy enough.
I came in with a fellow who was driving
cattle into town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sed!&rdquo; his sister whispered; &ldquo;you
ran an awful risk; how will you manage to
get back without being discovered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no trouble about that,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you and mother go and
worry yourselves about me. I&rsquo;ll be all
right, so cheer up and don&rsquo;t look so doleful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urged on by fear, they now almost hurried
him away, and Mammy, while filling
his haversack with provisions, entreated
him to be careful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De ain&rsquo;t no tellin&rsquo; what dem Yankees
would do ef dey once clapt hands on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sedley might guess shrewdly enough
what his fate would be in such case, but
he replied, with his old boyish laugh, that
it was his trade to outrun the Yankees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never fear, Mammy,&rdquo; he said at parting.
&ldquo;Trust me to beat &rsquo;em at that game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the sad good-byes were said, and
manfully he strode down the little path,
turning only once to wave a last good-by
to the sorrowful group on the broad front
porch, who watched till he passed out of
sight.</p>

<p>The night was spent in anxious watching,
but confidence returned with the morning,
and all again settled back to their
employments and amusements. Sybil wandered
into the parlor, and, sitting down to
the piano, sang in a low, sweet voice some
of the pathetic war melodies. The &ldquo;colts
of the wild ass seeking after every green
thing&rdquo; had sought the sorghum patch, and
Mammy had taken a basket into the garden
for a final gathering of sage leaves. The
day was dreamy, as only an October day of
the South can be. The tempered sunlight,
streaming softly through the filmy autumnal
mist, threw a veil of loveliness over the
homeliest objects; the old gray fences, the
russet fields, the lonely pastures, where
from beneath the grass roots the tiny
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
crickets chanted their low, sweet dirge the
long day through, the cawing of the crows
from a distant tree-top, all told in notes of
most harmonious pathos that &ldquo;the fashion
of this world passeth away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mammy, with back stiffened from
stooping, raised herself for a moment&rsquo;s rest,
she saw Jim lounge into the backyard and
speak to Dinah. Mammy had but little use
for Jim in general, but now she felt anxious
to know what had been going on in the village,
and for that reason she left her basket
among the sage and went near to hear what
he was saying. As she drew near, Dinah
suddenly threw up her hands, and, starting
from the hencoop on which she had been
leaning, came towards her, stuttering and
stammering in a manner so excited as to
be unintelligible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s dat you say? For Gods sake,
ooman, say what yere got to say, an&rsquo; be
done wid it!&rdquo; said Mammy, too frightened
to be patient. Jim then drew near
to her and, glancing cautiously towards
the not very distant piazza, upon which
his mistress happened at the moment to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
be standing, he whispered, &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;s done
ketched him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;K-k-ketched who?&rdquo; stammered Mammy
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mas&rsquo; Sedley, dat&rsquo;s who,&rdquo; Jim answered
doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you know? I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve a word
on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, dey&rsquo;s done done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho&rsquo; come you know so much &rsquo;bout it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I seen &rsquo;em when dey done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-y-you have de face to stan&rsquo; da an&rsquo;
tell me dat you seen &rsquo;em a-troublin&rsquo; dat
chile an&rsquo; you not lif&rsquo; a han&rsquo; to help him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I gwine help him? G&rsquo;long, you
don&rsquo;t know what you talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;bouts did dey come across him?&rdquo;
Mammy inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right down yonder at de mill,&rdquo; Jim answered,
nodding his head in the direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Mammy, &ldquo;dey
must &rsquo;a&rsquo; ketched him directly after he went
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conversation was carried on in such
low murmurings that even a listener at a
short distance could not have distinguished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
what was said; the three were very intent,
but did not omit occasional cautious glances
in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Jim replied; &ldquo;an&rsquo; den dey
shet him up in de mill house, and den I
never seed no mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;cause I was skeered an&rsquo;
runned away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, after an uneasy pause, he added,
&ldquo;I come &rsquo;long dat-a-way soon dis mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
and here he murmured so low into Mammy&rsquo;s
ear that Dinah, though she stretched
her neck, could not catch the word, which
turned Mammy&rsquo;s brown face to ashen gray.
She stood for a minute like one turned to
stone, then staggered to her own doorstep.
Sitting down, she buried her head in her
apron, and so sat motionless for half an
hour, while Jim and Dinah continued their
guarded murmurings by the hencoop. At
the end of half an hour she rose, took a
bunch of keys from her pocket, went into
her house and, closing the door behind her,
unlocked her chest. Drawing from it a
little workbox, which had, in years gone by,
been one of Caroline&rsquo;s cherished Christmas
gifts, she opened it. From beneath her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
Sunday pocket handkerchief, and a few
other articles of special value, she produced
another and smaller box which she opened,
and, taking from it a gold coin, looked at it
tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Po&rsquo; little fellow! God bless him! he
give me this that fus&rsquo; time he come home
from school. I never &rsquo;spected to part with
it, but ef it&rsquo;s de Lord&rsquo;s will, it may help him
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these thoughts, Mammy quickly
replaced the things in her chest, put the
coin into her pocket, and, taking up the
man&rsquo;s hat, which upon week days she always
wore, she strode off towards the mill.</p>

<p>As she passed by the piazza, she paused
one moment irresolute, but murmuring to
herself, &ldquo;&rsquo;T ain&rsquo;t no use upsettin&rsquo; Mistis,
po&rsquo; cretur, and I can do it better by myself
anyhow,&rdquo; she walked briskly forward, revolving
in her mind her plan.</p>

<p>The mill house consisted of two rooms,
and in the one in which Jim had reported
Sedley to be confined there was a small trap-door.
It had been used for regulating the
working of the machinery, and led from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
beneath the house directly to the creek, which
ran close to the walls of the house. This trap
Mammy had once happened to see opened,
and in that way knew of its existence, otherwise
she would never have suspected it,
as, from its infrequent use, it was usually
covered with dust and dirt and could not
be distinguished from the rest of the floor.
Her plan was to endeavor to get speech
with Sedley, tell him of the trap-door, and
leave the rest to him. Her great fear had
been that she might be refused admittance
to him, and hence it was that she
had thought of her gold piece, as she hoped
by its potent influence to be given a few
minutes alone with the prisoner.</p>

<p>There would be no great difficulty for
Sedley to lift the trap without noise and,
when it was lifted, to swing himself through
to the ground, to creep until he came to the
thick tangle upon the creek banks, then to
swim across and escape into the shelter of
the woods beyond. That would be simple
enough, and Mammy, full of hopeful
thoughts, was walking briskly forward,
when suddenly a turn in the path brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
into view a small body of Federals, all
mounted, and evidently coming from the
direction of the mill. They seemed in haste,
and she could hear the rattle of their sabres
as they cantered by.</p>

<p>Standing amid the broom-sedge, Mammy
watched them, casting eager, anxious looks
upon them, fearing, dreading to see her boy
in their midst, a poor, defenseless captive.
Finally, as the last horseman disappeared,
she heaved a sigh of infinite relief. &ldquo;Bless
de good Lord, dey ain&rsquo;t took de po&rsquo; chile
wid &rsquo;em,&rdquo; and so went on her way.</p>

<p>At length the gray gables of the little
mill house came into view, and Mammy,
feeling in her pocket to assure herself that
the gold piece was safe at hand, went boldly
forward, telling herself that, if she spoke
politely, the Yankee guard would not shoot
her. So she went on until the little mill
came into full view, but with no guard or
any other object to inspire fear. All seemed
quiet, and the place quite deserted. There
were footprints about the door, and broken
bushes showed the trampling of both men
and horses, but now all was very quiet.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
The old mill house looked very peaceful,
with the yellow autumnal sun shining
upon its moss-grown roof, with no sound
to break the deep silence, save the low,
continuous warbling of a solitary mockingbird
which, perched upon an overhanging
bough, seemed to review its past joys in
low, sweet notes of retrospection.</p>

<p>Upon seeing that the place was quite
deserted, Mammy paused, and, after looking
around to satisfy herself that this was
really the case, ascended the steps and, lifting
the latch of the door, looked into the
outer room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she murmured, upon
finding it empty. &ldquo;Thank God! dey&rsquo;s all
took deyselves off to town an&rsquo; lef&rsquo; him here,
locked up by hisself. It raly is &rsquo;stonishin&rsquo;
to think how foolish dem creturs is; dey
mout ha&rsquo; knowed as someon&rsquo; would ha&rsquo;
come an&rsquo; let him loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While thus thinking, she had crossed
the room, and was now endeavoring to
open the door, which gave admittance
to the inner and larger apartment. Finding,
as she had anticipated, that this door
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
was fastened, she first called to the prisoner
within, and, when no answer was returned,
she shook the door until at length
the crazy old lock gave way and the door
creaked slowly back upon its rusty hinges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honey, whar&rsquo;bouts is you?&rdquo; Mammy
questioned, as, pausing upon the threshold,
she peered into the obscurity beyond.
The windowless room was dark, and
Mammy, after again calling, groped her
way in, straining her eyes into the gloom,
but unable to discern any object. Then,
suddenly, the deep silence and the gloom
smote upon her senses, and a great horror
came over her. She turned to rush from
the room, when her eyes, grown more accustomed
to the darkness, fell upon an
object which froze the lifeblood in her
veins. It lay almost at her feet. She
stooped and bent over it, with thick, laboring
breath. Very still it lay, with set
white face and wide-open, unseeing eyes.</p>

<h2>WAR REMINISCENCES</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapir"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> remember when Wheeler&rsquo;s
cavalry passed through
town that the men, when
halted, just dropped in the
streets and slept, so that passers-by were
forced to step over them, but in spite of
starvation and weariness the old indomitable
spirit would assert itself. One of the
poor fellows, while the column was passing
by Christ Church, looked up at the weathercock
and remarked to a comrade that it was
the first and only instance of Wheeler&rsquo;s boys
seeing a chicken which they could not get at.</p>

<p>We were singularly fortunate in the
neighborhood of Raleigh in having no lack
of wholesome food, and in being able to
send boxes of provisions to the army around
Petersburg. We, in particular, were plentifully
supplied from the plantation, a four-horse
wagon being constantly engaged in
hauling supplies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
One of the greatest taxes upon our resources,
and the event that brought the war
very closely home to us, was the advent of
the cavalcade and ambulances referred to in
my notes concerning My Own Early Home.</p>

<p>Most of the horsemen who had come
with the ambulances returned to the front
the next morning, leaving behind them six
or more sick and wounded, with their surgeon
and friends to look after them. Fortunately,
the office in the yard (a house
with two comfortable rooms) was easily
made ready and the wounded men were installed
in the quarters which they kept for
a month. The wound which afterwards deprived
one of the wounded, a young man
by the name of Nat Butler, of his arm, was
by far the most serious. The attempt to
save the arm came very near costing him
his life. Instead of healing, the wound constantly
sloughed, with great loss of blood.
As the wound was between the elbow and
the shoulder, the danger attending amputation
increased with each sloughing, but the
poor boy was deaf to all that his doctor
could urge, positively refusing to have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
arm amputated, and he grew weaker and
weaker with every hemorrhage. Meantime
several of the sick and wounded were so
far cured as to be able to return to duty.
Captain Butler (an older brother of Nat
Butler), Dr. Thompson, Mr. Taylor, and
several others whose names I have forgotten,
and the bugler, named Glanton, still
remained. One morning, while I was in the
mealroom getting out dinner, I heard Captain
Butler&rsquo;s voice calling loudly that young
Butler was bleeding to death. I just took
time to call out to my daughters, Annie and
Kate, who were just starting to town, to drive
as quickly as they could to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s and
to ask him to come. Then I ran down to
the office, where I found the poor old captain
frantic with terror and quite unable to
do anything for the patient, who lay senseless
and bleeding upon the bed. I can never
forget his ghastly appearance; I never saw
so bloodless a face. The mouth, partly open,
showed a tongue bluish like new flannel.
I went to the bedside and pressed the arm
above the wound, as hard as I could, and I
held it so until the arrival of Dr. Johnson. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
had thus succeeded in partially arresting the
hemorrhage, and possibly may have saved
young Butler&rsquo;s life. I started to leave as
soon as the doctor came, and when I arose
from my knees, I realized for the first time
that I was covered with blood. The amputation
could no longer be deferred, and the
operation took place as soon as the patient&rsquo;s
strength permitted, which was, I think, two
days after the hemorrhage. There was then
barely a chance that he could survive in his
weak condition. I shall never forget how
the girls and I sat upon the front steps and
watched the silent men standing before the
office,&mdash;it seemed as though the suspense
would never end. After the amputation,
Butler lay for twenty-four hours like one
dead. Finally, when he did rally sufficiently
to be given something, I sent our excellent
nurse, Caroline, to take care of him, for I
could not trust him to the ignorant though
kindly meant attentions of his friends. At
this time General Galbraith Butler was our
guest, and, as the Norrises had now left
for Richmond, I gave him a room in the
house. He was quite ill there for several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
days, during which time the house was
thronged with messengers from the front.
It gives me pleasure to say that they conducted
themselves like polished gentlemen,
who appreciated the comforts which they
received.</p>

<p>Under Caroline&rsquo;s devoted nursing Nat
Butler slowly returned to life and to a degree
of strength. When it became evident
that Raleigh would soon be in possession
of the enemy, Nat Butler declared that he
preferred the risk of dying by exposure to
that of being captured. It was with the
saddest forebodings that we prepared for
his departure. The ambulance was made
comfortable with pillows, blankets, etc., and
nothing was omitted that could contribute
to the well-being of the poor sufferer. It
was a painful parting, as we all knew that
we were on the eve of horrors that we dared
not contemplate. The moon shone upon
the sorrowful little cort&egrave;ge, as it passed
beneath the trees, and we were too sad for
tears, as we watched it go slowly out of
sight. Nat Butler lived, and visited us a
year later, but his life was a brief one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
We were up late that night, bidding adieu
to many friends. Indeed, the past few days
had been days of varied and intense excitement.
People who under ordinary circumstances
would have scarcely recognized each
other as acquaintances now met and parted
as old and dear friends. Mounted officers
would come cantering up just for a handshake
and a God-keep-you. We were admonished
to take off rings or any little bits of jewelry
which we might wear. A gentleman sitting
by me had concealed my watch in my ball
of knitting cotton. People everywhere were
wildly seeking places wherein to conceal
their valuables. We had no reason to imagine
that our house was safer than others, but
we could not refuse to receive the trunks
and boxes brought to us in desperation, by
refugees chiefly, who were leaving town in
a panic, and going they knew not whither.
All that we could promise was that they
should be as well cared for as were our own;
and so the garret was packed with all sorts
of trunks and boxes, many of which were
not claimed until the next autumn.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to give you an idea of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
the excitement and turmoil of that last
week of the Confederacy. Every minute of
your grandfather&rsquo;s time was taken up with
his duties as a state officer, until he, in
company with Governor Graham and Dr.
Warren, were despatched by Governor
Vance to meet Sherman with a flag of
truce and to surrender the town. He was
absent upon this mission upon a night that I
happened to go into the dining-room and
found several rough-looking men, whom I
took to be Confederates, seated at supper.
Robert was waiting upon them, and Adelaide
talking, while one of my little children
was seated cosily upon the knee of a particularly
dirty-looking man. This did not
please me, for there was a freedom of manner
about them which I had never seen in one of
our men before. Still, I had no suspicion that
they were not what they seemed, and, being
called off, I left them, although a certain
uncomfortable feeling caused me to do
so unwillingly. Just as I left, a clatter of
horses&rsquo; feet was heard outside, and Adelaide
(always loquacious), exclaimed, &ldquo;Here
comes the General and his staff!&rdquo; The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
words were scarcely uttered before the
men jumped from their seats and dashed
from the room. We were afterwards convinced
that they were some of the scum of
Sherman&rsquo;s army, and while we (myself and
daughters) were sitting quite unsuspectingly,
they were lurking near us.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention that, at our urgent
invitation, our dear friends the Burgwyns
had come to us, and, in the midst of other
distractions, I was occupied in disposing
of their numerous boxes, barrels, and pictures.
There was a universal feeling that
there would be a degree of safety in numbers,
and we could not possibly have enjoyed
more congenial companionship than
that of our cousins, the Burgwyns. Upon
that day we prepared twenty lunches, which
were most thankfully received. I recollect
that towards evening some hot tea was
made for our old friend, Mr. John Robinson.
He had been at work all day, shipping
freight and provisions, and transferring engines
to Greensboro, to which place he was
now going. He had had nothing to eat, and
was, as you may imagine, very tired, and so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
hungry that his lunch of cold ham, bread,
and butter, with many cups of tea, was so
much enjoyed that in after life he often
spoke of it with real gratitude. When he
said good-by, he gave into my keeping a little
box of trinkets, requesting me to keep
them for him, as he had no idea what his
destination might be. I, of course, said that
I would try to keep them safely; and I did,
returning them just as I had received them,
some months later.</p>

<p>Upon that day, our dinner was but a
meagre one, consisting chiefly of soup, and,
as the very last of the silver had been hidden
out of sight, we were compelled to take
it from teacups. Upon that night, after the
stir and bustle of the day had subsided,
after the last good-by had been uttered, and
the last horseman had galloped away, a most
intense stillness followed, which, if possible,
increased our melancholy, and magnified
our fearful apprehensions of what was to
come.</p>

<p>On the following morning, I saw three
odd, rough-looking men come galloping
up from the barn. They were mounted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
upon mules, were seated far forward upon
the withers, and had their knees drawn up
after a most ungainly fashion. I saw at a
glance that they were not our countrymen.
They rode furiously into the yard, where
they halted abruptly. The servants stood
gaping at them in stupid bewilderment. I
went forward and asked them the meaning
of this intrusion. Their reply was an insolent
demand for my keys. Then I knew
that they were bummers. During the
whole of this period your grandfather had
had more than his hands full at his office,
taking care of and sending off government
stores, and doing a thousand other things,
so that all the domestic offices rested with
me. I told the bummers, with a great show
of courage, that I had no idea of giving them
my keys, and as I walked off, feeling quite
triumphant, I had the mortification of seeing
them dismount and swagger to the
doors of the mealroom, smokehouse, and
storeroom, slip their miserable, dastardly
swords into the locks, and open the doors,
with the most perfect ease. Conscious now
of my own weakness, I would not condescend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
to parley with them, and watched
them at their insolent and thievish game,
until their mules were almost hidden beneath
the load of hams, sausages, and other
plunder. Then they remounted, and dashed
off at the same furious pace as they had come.
In a little time after others came and played
the same game, only adding to their abominable
thievishness by driving off our mules
and all our cattle. Our horses, I am glad
to say, had been sent away.</p>

<p>It was towards noon upon that fatal day
that we espied a long blue line crawling
serpent-like around a distant hill. Silently
we watched, as it uncoiled itself, ever drawing
nearer and still nearer, until the one
great reptile developed into many reptiles
and took the form of men. Men in blue
tramping everywhere, horsemen careering
about us with no apparent object, wagons
crashing through fences as though they
had been made of paper. The negroes
stood like dumb things, in stupid dismay.
It was at a later period that their time of
joy came (in many instances it never came);
then the only feeling was one of awe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
In an incredibly short time tents were
pitched, the flag run up, and the Yankees
were here. The crowd grew more dense.
A large column was passing through the
grove at almost a run, when, to my horror,
I saw Adelaide and Lizzie, each with one
of my little girls in her arms, rushing along
in their midst in a state of such wild excitement
that they had almost lost their reason.
Almost in despair, I rushed after them, sometimes
seeing them, only to lose them again
in the moving mass. As I passed a soldier
I signed to him for help; I do not think I
could have spoken. He saw the danger that
threatened my children, and, overtaking the
two nurses, took the children and brought
them to me. The women had meant no
harm, and did not realize the risk.</p>

<p>As I before remarked, every one during
this period of panic entertained an idea
that he must commit his valuables to the
keeping of some one else; for instance,
my sister gave her set of pearls to her maid
Sally for safe keeping, and Sally, in her turn,
brought them to Caroline (her mother).
Caroline, not knowing a safe place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
concealment, lifted a stone from her hearth,
placed the casket in the cavity, and replaced
the stone; this, however, caused the stone
to fit loosely in the hole from which it had
been displaced, and Caroline, in her fear
lest this should lead to the discovery of the
pearls, sat all night with her feet resting
upon it. She came to me in the morning,
looking perfectly haggard, and told me that
she had never before passed through such
a night of horror, for her house had been
crowded with Federals, prying into every
corner and taking whatever they fancied.
With my sister&rsquo;s casket, she handed me a
red cotton handkerchief tied up and full of
silver coins, belonging to herself and her
husband. She had no place in which to
keep it, and asked me to take care of it. I,
of course, took charge of it and kept it for
her until the last bluecoat had left the
place, which was not until August; for,
after the departure of the army, a regiment
was left in our grove.</p>

<p>One day General Logan came to the
door and said that he had reason to believe
that a Confederate officer was concealed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
the house, and, if I kept his presence a
secret, he threatened me with the consequences.
The Federals, while searching for
buried treasure, had discovered the amputated
arm of poor young Butler, and had
jumped to the conclusion that he was concealed
in the house. At all events, it served
as a plea for them to claim that he was
there. When I assured him that this rumor
was quite false, his manner was so utterly
incredulous that I requested him to satisfy
himself of the truth of my assertion by making
a search of the entire house and outbuildings.
I entreated him to do this, for
his threats had so alarmed me that I felt
that in that alone lay our preservation. His
reply, with an insolent, jeering laugh, was:
&ldquo;I will not take that trouble, for my boys
will settle that question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The safeguards stationed both at the
back and front protected the house. For,
whatever might have been their feelings,
they dared not relax in their vigilance.
The discipline in that army was perfect.</p>

<p>Not long after the above-mentioned interview
with Logan, we were told (by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
servant, I think), that the whole division
was going to leave that night. This was
true. It was before the articles of the surrender
had been signed, and Logan was in
pursuit of General Johnston. It was a night
of such commotion that not one of the family
retired to rest. It was discovered, when
too late for redress, that Logan had withdrawn
our safeguards, taken every commanding
officer with him, and had left us
to the mercy of his wagon train of bummers
and of negroes. That night of terror
terminated in a violent storm, in the midst
of which your grandfather set out for the
headquarters in town for the purpose of demanding
a safeguard. With daylight came
a greater feeling of safety, so we separated,
the girls going to their rooms, and I to mine,
in order to refresh ourselves and make a
fresh toilet. While so engaged, I kept hearing
the bells ringing and tinkling incessantly,
and, while I was hurrying to put on
my dress in order to inquire the meaning of
this, Caroline and Adelaide rushed in, exclaiming
that men were climbing the walls
of the house, and the tinkling of the bells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
was caused by their twisting them off the
wires. These women, whose natural color
was bright mulatto, now looked ashy. I do
not think that I spoke a word, but just flew
into the nursery, took the children, and ran
up the stairs. As I passed by the sitting,
room, I met Kate, all disheveled, running
out and saying that men were climbing
into her window. I just took time to lock
the door between her room and the sitting-room,
and then we all ran upstairs, where the
Burgwyns and my other girls were quietly
dressing, in entire ignorance of what was
taking place. It seems strange that I should
recollect every trifle so vividly; I remember,
even now, that, as I ran up the stair, my
throat and mouth became so dry that I
could not speak. From the window at the
head of the stair nothing was visible but a
sea of upturned faces; not just by the house,
but away down the slope, as far as the eye
could reach, were men&rsquo;s upturned faces.
I can never forget the look upon Mrs.
Burgwyn&rsquo;s face as she whispered, &ldquo;We
can throw ourselves from the window.&rdquo;
My poor, craven heart might have failed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
me, but I am convinced that she could have
done it. While we thus stood, a poor, cowering,
terror-stricken group, steps were
heard approaching, and a tall figure slowly
ascended the stairs, and a grim, saturnine-faced
man stood before us, and said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I can save you, but for the
sake of my mother and sisters I will do all
that I can do.&rdquo; I do not remember whether
any one made a reply or not, I only recollect
that he went as deliberately as he had
come. When your grandfather returned,
having with difficulty succeeded in procuring
the permit for a safeguard, the mob
had begun to disperse. Our deliverer was
a man named Fort. He was division quartermaster,
and had been left in charge of
the wagon trains. He was from one of the
Western States, Iowa, I believe. He was
a good man, and was God&rsquo;s instrument to
save us from destruction. He remained
near the house all through the day, and at
first said that he would sleep that night inside
the dwelling, but afterwards told your
grandfather that, upon further consideration,
he thought it best that he should stay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
outside, so his tent was pitched close to the
house, and there he remained until his command
left. He was forbidding in manner,
and would accept no thanks. I think that
he hated us as Southerners, but acted from
humanity.</p>

<p>Mr. Burgwyn was suffering from an apoplectic
stroke, and was lying insensible. My
son had not returned from Appomattox.
Had any man been with us, he would have
been utterly helpless, and would probably
have been murdered.</p>

<p>One day, either immediately preceding
or following the incident just related, our
ever-faithful man, Frank, stealthily entered
the house. He was evidently afraid of being
observed, for he slipped in, and, closing the
door after him, asked to speak a word to
his master. When your grandfather came,
Frank almost whispered his communication,
as though afraid of being overheard.
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I come to ask you,
please, sir, don&rsquo;t go out of the house to-day;&rdquo;
he would not say why he gave this
warning, and it was not until afterwards
that we found that the Federals had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
intended to hang your grandfather up until
he told them where our silver was hidden.
I rejoice to say that they did not get one
piece of it, although a part of it was buried
in the branch that runs at the foot of the
grove, and, in digging out a place for watering
their horses, they had actually thrown
the sand upon the box, thus burying it
deeper.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 3em;">I could relate many other incidents of
this period, some of them rather amusing;
but it is time to bring my reminiscences to
a close. But before doing so, I must say a
word about our last safeguard, Monhagan.
He was Irish, and possessed all of the best
attributes of the Irish character. After the
departure of Logan&rsquo;s division, with the rest
of Sherman&rsquo;s army, this man was deputed
to guard the place, as a regiment was still
quartered in the grove. He stayed until
August, and, besides faithfully discharging
his duties, he exerted himself in other and
various ways to ameliorate the inconveniences
to which we were subjected. Our
servants, lounging in idleness, contented
themselves with professions as idle. Frank,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
acting upon his master&rsquo;s advice, had taken
his family to the plantation. Adelaide was
ill the greater part of the summer with
brain fever. Monhagan worked the garden,
gathered fruit and vegetables, and performed
many other services. I felt a little
amused when he one day brought me all
his money and asked me to take care of it
for him. At first I positively refused to
take upon myself this responsibility, but
yielded at last, and made him count it, and
kept it as long as he remained. Every Saturday
afternoon he would come and ask
me to let him have one dollar and allow
him to go to town for a little while. He
left with the regiment in August, and he
wrote once to your uncle Tom from New
York, but omitted to give his address,
which we regretted, as we would have liked
to have him as a gardener.</p>
